physical,I (M) wrote this to my current partner (F) after her latest meltdown. I'm really struggling to know what to do and I feel trapped. Please help,"""If you can't hold off on the abusive behaviours (accusations, jealousy, paranoia, mistreatment of me generally) while pregnant to save the baby being damaged by the resulting stress and your potential irrational decisions that could follow (attempted overdose, self harm, for example) then how can I trust you with our child when he/she arrives? I thought this time could allow me to grow confident in your ability to behave reasonably and responsibly, but given what keeps happening I'm having serious doubts about that.   You care more about some delusion and paranoia surrounding the apparent idea that I find trans people attractive (I said I dont several times and you pushed until I said something that you could misconstrue as me admitting my 'secret seedy trans fetish'... ) than you do about the happiness of us as a family and therefore the happiness of our baby.  And then there's the effect on me. Which you already know all about, but that doesn't seem to enter your mind before you accuse me of this shit or mistreat me for literally no reason. I have feelings too, and these accusations really destroy my self confidence and sense of self. I know who I am, and it's not the piece of shit you label me whenever you make these accusations. Sooner or later though you'll start to believe these things, especially if they're coming from someone you love and who whose judgement you rely on and are supposed to trust.   We've It's been through this about fifty times already (sadly not an exaggeration as this is almost a daily occurance, it's at least bi-weekly before you get angry) with me giving you opportunity after opportunity to make things right and it's really important that you either work to make this better or decide how you're going to live your life separate from me other than with stuff involving the baby.   I'm almost sending this as a record, part of me thinks you're going to do something terrible and I need to have my position and the realities of this written down before it becomes clouded by the same non-realities you confront me with so regularly. If you do anything then at least people will know what's been going on.   I don't care if you think the last bit is mad. You're not sat in my shoes dealing with this. Again, you're the one doing it to me. I am not doing any of this to you.   You harass me about the fact that I knew women before meeting you (even just as friends) and meanwhile you were sleeping with someone on our uni course while we were dating. You accuse me daily of fancying people on TV to the point where we can't really watch anything. You police my line of sight when we are in public by constantly accusing me of being a ""pervert"" who starts at women... this reaching a dangerous point to where i can't look to see if traffic is coming when I'm driving in case you accuse me of looking at women (this has happened, we've talked about it on multiple occasions and you've accepted that it's dangerous...). I could keep going, but spending this sunny afternoon that I'd planned a day out for us on writing down things that make me feel horrible isn't helping my mental health. So I'll stop. Not because there isn't more to say, but because I don't want to relive these things and actually think about them, it's better than I move them to the back of my head and see them as the flittering, impermanent things they are than to dwell on them and start seeing our entire relationship as this.  I love you, I'm trying to get through this, but you really do worry me and I'm worried about your ability to be my partner and the mother of our child. It's important you fix this or at least admit that it's real to begin working on it. It's more than just you and I that rely on this working. And this doesn't have to be for 'us', even if you decide to go your own way then I want you to be well and fornour child to grow up with a mother who is healthy xx"""

physical,making a plan isnt easy,"&amp;#x200B;  reading up on how to get out of an abusive situation and there is a lot of focus on making a plan on a date to leave like as one of the main steps. I want to get out of this situation but I don't see myself being able to get out of it for at least 2-3 years because of my financial situation. I dont want to keep going further into dept and I think staying at a homeless shelter would be worse for me because unstable environments are something i have a realllllly hard time with.  i just feel like all this advice doesnt work for me. it makes me feel bad that i cant come up with a plan other than im gonna leave in 2-3 years and thats it. i guess im just frustrated. like come up with a plan to leave and then what? everything i read makes it sound so easy. what happens when you're homeless cause you leave? for me, i feel like its more scary to be homeless than be with someone you cared about who is causing you harm. i dont think i would ever be able to live at a homeless shelter. if im homeless, i see myself living in a car and its more scary than the violence i experience too. i know why people recommend leaving as soon as possible but what if you're stuck and you cant. it makes you feel worse knowing you cant do it."
physical,How can I convince my mother to leave my abusive father,"(18F) My parents(58M) (56F) have been married 30+ years. Lately it's turned from emotional abuse and threats of violence to recently the one time my mother actually left me alone with my father, my lip is swollen and my whole body hurting from being chased, grabbed and struggling to escape on a hardwood floor.  My stress levels are through the roof and I can't take this any longer. I have been experiencing a frightening lack of energy on top of being more sensitive to triggers. My ED came back and it feels like all the progress I've been making trying to heal in a home like this is gone.   I can't imagine after over 30 years how broken down my mother is, but she's afraid of change. She's afraid to leave him. And yes, I'm 18, I could leave now and leave everything behind but I don't want to leave her alone with him. I don't know what to do."
physical,"I don't know why I am posting, what I want, or what I am asking; Maybe I just need to vent, maybe I need someone to understand.","(Flair applied just to be safe, I kept it to as little detail as possible.)  Like likely many people here, there are two sides to my relationship, what people see, and what actually happens, that very much skew how others see it, and how I myself question it. I will try to keep this as brief as possible, and at least well sorted, but it will likely become quite a rant, for which I apologize, but there are so many angles and so much history to this.  On the outside, basic appearances: I married my best friend, who is gorgeous, and had several kids with her, have been together for over 10 years. When we got together, I was in college, and for the first few years had a good career going.  I slowly went from goofy, outgoing, to quite, anxious loner, even as the group of people around me grew, jobs started to fall through, and distanced from all of my old friends, and distant family, centering my life around her and my children.  What was going on in the relationship, was the classic 'testing the waters' and seeing how far I could be pushed. It started with getting slapped in response to saying something unwanted, escalating to throwing boxes of my belongings around, pushing me down stairs, stabbing me with pens, etc. (I want to be clear, this has been reported and legally dealt with, as I will talk about shortly.) She takes on loans and debt, spends all of our money on herself, barely enough for the bills which are constantly kept at just short of being cut off, and barely enough food, despite more than enough income technically. We have very minimal sex, and while I *think* she has never cheated, she fairly openly tries to, from 'just seeing if they would if she wanted to,' to asking someone to bed right in front of me on a day where 'she decided to break up with me,' to literally telling me specific people she hangs out with only when we are fighting, to make me question if she is, to going on dating sites, and showing me when she is angry. That said, she genuinely seems unable to bring herself to, only to have it as a go to threat when angry, and a go to outlet when she needs a boost, I guess?  When we go to break up, she makes promises of letting me take over the finances, of the violence ending, (it often does for many months, long enough to make me convince myself against my better judgement,) and the sex comes back fantastically. The promises never last, the finances never get better, and the relationship falls to hell again. When the promises don't convince me, she blackmails me with having nowhere to go, nowhere for my daughters to go. Which is sort of true. I have even asked her parents, in all manner of ways, from out of anger, to literally crying that I can't handle her anymore, and in between, trying to explain to them that no one is happy here, and they will say to me ""where else does she have to go?""  On that note, twice it has gotten to the point of requiring me to call the police. The first time, she sent a family member to pick up our kids at school, and broke into my house while I was out, all in defiance of a restraining order/her probation; The officers refused to do anything about it, she harassed me about how bad her living situation was, and would be, and so I took her back, planning to leave her our house. (She has ample income herself from various government programs, but is also perpetually paying on many debts, which is why she has had no problems ruining jobs and opportunities for me over the years.) Various supports were offered to her as a victim, (""he deserved it"" mentality,"") and I was told to not aggravate her.  Then, I lost access to a large inheritance, (an entire other story,) Covid and the lockdowns hit. Jobs got worse, the relationship got worse, and again, it required police involvement, and this time, I allowed contact, because there was no way I could manage things on my own, and during the first time, she had gotten custody of our children.  I have kind of resigned myself to staying at this point until they are out of the house......except, she is very adamant we will have another child, threatening and blackmailing if I don't. Her parents, once again, agree we shouldn't, but still support her 'making her own choices,' even knowing I am against it as well.  In my real life, most people don't know most of this, those that do never believe me how bad it is, and those that even entertain the idea wonder why I am still here. My parents split when I was younger, and one of the children we have is mine from a previous relationship; I have a serious aversion to splitting another family. Despite everything we have been through, I still love her, and want her to do well in life; In between, she is an incredible person.  People don't understand how broken and trapped I am, with no one to talk to about it, no money to get away that isn't taking directly from my children's mouths, no legal recourse, at this point I feel like police involvement would seem like harassment.  When we fight, she somehow convinces me that calling the police, not her hitting, has caused our family so many problems; She has convinced me that her asking her friends if they would have sex with her is ok, but I have to try to avoid working around any women, and she borrows money from my family behind my back, to give to hers, etc.)  Like I said in the title, I really don't know what I want from this. Validation, maybe, or even just knowing someone read it. I really want someone to talk to, but in that regard, I really want a friend, more than someone to vent this to all the time; Advice is more than welcome, but I really just need a friend.  If you happen to look over my profile history, please keep in mind, this is a throwaway account, and while there are things that don't show me in a positive light, this account is really the sad, secret hideaway of a broken, lonely person.  I also realized at many points that the children are very relevant to this conversation, and someone is likely to point out that I have said little about them. I assure you, I often do, every moment, and that is one of the biggest reasons I stay, by a long shot, but felt there was enough here already, plenty that needed to be left out for brevity, and I have done a good enough job deflecting her anger towards me, that I don't feel they are in any danger, her maternal instincts are quite strong, and in this case, useful.  Anyways, if you read all of this, thank you for reading. :)"
physical,Remember the girl that started to smile? Well hard to smile now when he moved halfway across the country to live a mile away from me.,"(My post [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/norrqj/its_been_awhile_since_i_smiled_i_love_my_smile/).)  I moved to Austin, TX in June from NJ. He is now here. He moved in August in my best friend's building a mile from me. Because I came with no furniture, wifi issues, etc - I would stay at my friends. Even after finishing my place, I would visit her at least 2x a week because she's not the only friend in the building. We have a mutual best friend so it makes more sense for me to go there.  Anyways he's here. I don't know why.  I called NYPD to transfer restraining order to APD. They said it expired last Dec. It was supposed to go through this November. APD said I need an incident then to file a new one. Isn't moving halfway across the country enough of an incident?????  I can't (and dont really) leave my apartment. I have trouble sleeping, eating, focusing."
emotional,Just want to vent- he__ my only image of romance,"(TW- sexual assault)  My emotionally abusive boyfriend was my first adult relationship, my only one since, and my first physically intimate relationship. I__e had C-PTSD for the last few years since I left him, and I__e barely dated since. I hooked up with someone after my ex to try to get him out of my system, but there was no intimacy. Even with the few dates I__e gone on since, I haven__ felt romance or closeness (no surprise). The last time I tried to go on a date, he started treating me like my ex had on his worst days, which sent me back into a place of submission and appeasement, until he eventually sexually assaulted me. So that certainly doesn__ help lol.   I just want to be able to tell someone that it is so so so hard to think of love or romance because my only experiences of that are with my ex, before I realized how bad it was. I thought it was good and happy and romantic and loving at the beginning, until one day I realized I was sad and scared and hurt all the time. So now when I watch a romantic movie, try to think about being in a happy or safe relationship, or just try to imagine me having a partner next to me comforting me and sharing time with me, all it brings up are conflicting and upsetting memories of him.   I did date when I was younger, but it was so inconsequential that it doesn__ apply in the context of my adult dating life. So my only experience and my only context of __ove_ and the kind of intimacy you share with a long term, apparently loving, and physically intimate partner is my ex. But I just want to see a movie where the cute couple gets together and to be able to see myself in something like that one day without images of him interfering.   The logical part of me knows it will happen, but it__ been two years. I just want to be healed.   (I__ in therapy and all ok, just a sad night. Of course something always comes up the day after therapy, never the day before lol.)"
emotional,Am I absolutely crazy for thinking this is Abuse?,"(Tw suicide)  Last year a few people made a 120+ page document detailing every wrong thing another user has done. They've been upfront in saying they can't get evidence of some stuff, otherwise I suspect it would be a lot longer. Nothing she did was illegal, it was mainly a collection of times she either lost her temper, said ignorant transphobic things, or made some Tweets about somebody else that look like they were probably lies. She made a failed attempt to raise awareness for #BLM by comparing real life oppression to the oppression in her online story, which came across as self-marketing-but even though she apologized 3 times off the top of my head and made a donation to make up for it, people are still dragging it up saying they'll never let her forget it.  She had conflict with some of her long distance staff members. She's been quite rude to them at timestimes. She doesn't seem like a saint and some of the sarcastic rude stuff she's said made me wince. But it's not a crime to be rude to people. She's accused people of things they didn't actually do and then deleted the Tweets when she got people saying ""well that's clearly not what happened"".  &amp;#x200B;  One of them as particularly angry she fired him because he/they supported their friends decision to try and get her show cancelled in the middle of COVID. I don't know if their intention was to cancel the show, but evidently she thought so, and fired the friends of the person who did it. From what I can tell, none of them ever forgave her for it.  I think the stuff she's done is worthy of criticism, but some of it was also 2 years ago. People are saying this is just accountability, but I think it's just bullying. There are people saying they hate her, she's a bad person, making entire videos about her, she's a piece of shit, never interact with her again...she has stated she's received lots of horrible messages and I believe her.  I've had a very bad feeling about all of it from the start. Many of her friends and staff members have come out to say she's a lovely person who has supported them. They say she hates men and treats them like scum but again, many male (I think) friends/staff have stated she's been great with them. They say it's disgusting she's including homophobia in her show. She's a bisexual woman writing about lesbians. Which I think she has the right to do. But they say it's wrong for her to include a storyline about homophobia. In fact he was so angry over this he leaked his voice lines and storyline to show how 'disgusting' it all was. Then when she said she could sue him for it he said she was threatening him.  They bring up a very dark and disturbing book she wrote when she was 14 saying it's disgusting and 'what the fuck is wrong with her'. I just think she was a 14 year old writing disturbing stories.  She would vent on Twitter about how she hates the show she's working on and wants to be free of it to work on other things. They took this and said it proves she must hate the staff members and fanbase and that she was being ungrateful.  They also accused her of stealing from her funding to buy an animation pen because she made a joke about it being ""sneaky"". But another animator came out and said it was perfectly fine for her to use the funding to buy an animation pen so she can do her animated series.  Every ""bad"" convo she's had with someone was made public. Including a screenshot of her saying to somebody how upset she is that all of her conversations are being leaked and that she feels everything she says and does even in private needs to be like a carefully crafted PR move because she knows it'll be on the Internet soon. They screenshotted it, leaked it, and said this was evidence of her playing the victim card and guilttripping them. Am I mad for thinking this is cyber stalking????  I was upfront and honest saying shez done some genuinely wrong things in the past but this isn't the way to deal with any of this and people need to cut it out. I said that this is cyberbullying that can tip someone over the edge, and if they refuse to change their behaviour then it will be on them if this ends in suicide.  I was not saying this woman will kill herself. I was saying that it is a very real possibility you have to take responsibility for when you upload a 120 page document of non-illegal reasons we should hate and avoid someone.  I said that I understand this woman has hurt them in the past and that it is understandable they are hurt and bitter over that and they have the right to defend themselves when she Tweets lies about people, but that this has gone too far and somebody hurting you or firing you doesn't give you the right to entirely tear them down in front of everyone. I said I can't pick and choose when I stand up for bullying. I said a bully victim can be imperfect and have done wrong things and have hurt people before, and still be the victim of bullying. Because bully victims are human just like we all are.  They said I guilttripped them, that I was bullying them, and that this wasn't bullying, it was just accountability and consequences for her actions. They publicly said I was suicide baiting them and it was an awful thing for me to have done. Lots of likes and retweets.  They also mocked me for bringing up a suicide risk, saying ""people don't just kill themselves at the drop of a hat"", ""you're running out of ideas to defend her from accountability"", ""she's too happy to kill herself"", ""somebody who is suicidal wouldn't continue the behaviours she does"". And then accused me of being transphobic even though I said many times I don't agree with the stuff she's said in the past.  My mental health plummeted to the point I deleted 95% of my comments defending her. I don't want to be manipulative. They said I was essentially using suicide to get what I wanted, which was for them to stop doing this to her.  I can't see why anyone would write a 120 page document about somebody's flaws. They say they're just warning people what she's really like. I just see a young woman making lots of mistakes, as we all do. Some of which she apologized for and some of which she hasn't. I definitely don't think she's dangerous enough to be warned about. Like, everyone does wrong things, it doesn't mean we deserve to be put on blast to the Internet for it. They keep saying they're just holding her accountable. I don't understand why we can't just criticize people in the moment, and then move on and let them grow. Not drag up stuff from 2 years ago.  On the rare occasions she has talked about it, nothing she says is right. If she defends herself it means she doesn't care and wants to play the victim card. If she apologizes it's not good enough. If she ignores it all she's just trying to escape the consequences of her actions.  I've been obsessing ever since. Was I wrong? My head keeps going over and over it.  I feel awful. Am I a bad person for questioning all of this stuff? Enough people are saying ""this is what accountability looks like it's not bullying"" that I'm worried it might be true and I was overreacting the whole time. Am I halting accountability by saying I think this is wrong? Am I overreacting for saying this is cyberbullying? Was I suicide baiting by saying all of this comes with a suicide risk? Am I allowed to criticize what she's done but also say I think she's become a victim?  They insist nobody's been harassed, but this woman has publicly said she had to shut down her Twitter for her own safety because of the messages and threats she's been getting. So they basically said she was lying about getting threats. The other day I caught someone telling her fans that they deserved to die. I have no trouble at all believing people have been threatening her.  I feel like I am going fucking bonkers. Like, legitimately, please somebody fucking help me work this out in my head. I feel like the craziest person in the world right now. I feel so guilty for thinking this way, because everybody else thinks what's happening is perfectly fine, so why can't I think that way too?? What's wrong with me??  What if everyone thinks I don't believe victims of abuse, because they're claiming they were victims of her? I do believe they were hurt by her and she treated them badly at points, but I just think they're going about it in such an...obsessive...way. Everyone I've talked to about this says this is clearly bullying but then I think about how many people online are saying she deserves it and I feel doubt all over again."
physical,I hate myself for being abused,"(TW: Please don__ read if you struggle with self blame)  A lot of things happened during this relationship that I feel like I could__e prevented, and I don__ know how to forgive myself. The first time we ever had sex, he raped me, and I just pretended it didn__ happen.   If I would__e told someone about that and gotten help for myself I would__e avoided him raping me again a few months later, this time destroying me mentally. After I lost in fighting him my spirit just sort of left my body. The best way I can describe that feeling is if you died suddenly, and your soul is fighting to hold on to this world, but then you just sort of let go.   I could__e helped myself then too but I didn__. If I would__e done something I wouldn__ have had to make up some stupid story to my mom when he broke my arm. I wouldn__ have had to wear scarves in the summer to cover up where he choked me. And yet I__ still depicted as the evil one, the stupid girl that should__e known better. He__ just the poor boy who grew up in a broken home that has issues he needs to sort out. Even my best friend says things like this.   I know it doesn__ help but I didn__ know how to cope with what I was feeling and started cutting myself. I truly do feel it is my fault even in spite of everyone saying that abuse is never your fault, I feel like it really is my fault. Terrible things happen to people all of the time that is their fault, like some car accidents. It__ a terrible thing nonetheless but still their fault. I had a responsibility to protect myself and I failed."
emotional,Why can__ my mum see the manipulation going on?,"(Venting)  I live 1/2 the week with my dad, 1/2 with my mum &amp; her boyfriend. For the 6 years that my step-dad has lived with us, every few months he will explode over a tiny thing that most of the time me/my brothers wouldn__ have even noticed. During the explosions he will berate us, and make us feel like we are extremely rude and disrespectful people when in reality he is the only one that has ever thought of us like that. I always respond to these outbursts very emotionally because I find them very upsetting, and I have always been told to just __oughen up_.  After my reaction he will apologise, but I have a hard time believing it is genuine because he never changes his actions and I think he just apologised to smooth things over.  Recently on holiday another outburst happened, worse than ever before. Part of this outburst was guilt tripping me and my brothers by saying ____ heartbroken for your mother, let__ sell the house_ in an attempt to make us feel like the reason for us splitting households was completely our faults. He has now effectively taken back the comment about splitting households. But I have decided that I am not giving him any more chances, and I do not want to live with him anymore.   So now, either we do sell the house and I live with my mum in a house away from him, or, I just live with my dad full time.   I feel like he is trying to manipulate my mum now, because when I talk to her about it she is beginning to say things that he has said before, that I know she would have never even thought of if he wasn__ there.   I don__ know how my mum can__ see how narcissistic and obsessed with respect and superiority he is, and I really don__ know what to do at this point.    (I don__ even know if this is considered emotional abuse, I just didn__ know what other place to vent)  TL;DR: my mum__ boyfriend explodes and manipulates and now I have to make a decision between continuing to live with my mum 1/2 the time, but being subjected to his behaviour, or just living with my dad full time.   Please PM me if you want to say anything outside of the comments."

emotional,I Don't Know How To Feel Anymore...,"**TW: threats of suicide and self harm**  Hi everyone,  I'm not sure how to start this, so for now I'll gloss over my story of abuse. I might post about it again here just to vent but right now, I think I just need some support or advice. I found out in March that my abuser moved on and found a new girlfriend and it has been bothering me ever since. I don't know exactly how I feel about it. Am I worried for their new girlfriend? Do I have a responsibility to warn her about what her partner is like? Does my abuser treat their girlfriend better than they did me? Do I still wish that my abuser liked me? All these questions run through my head every time I think about them. I feel like I'm crazy because my abuser seems happy with their new girlfriend. I know I don't want them back nor am I jealous because I'm in a very healthy, loving relationship right now. Has anyone else dealt with this? Is it normal to be bothered by this?"

emotional,Am I looking too much into this message from my abuser?,"__ut the way you're saying it, you're saying that the only way to not abuse you is to go out with you? Because not going out with you is abuse?_ This was his reply to me listing three options in healing from my ptsd, one of the options I listed was him ceasing his future faking/abuse. My words were exactly that, that he stopped his future faking and false promises, he someone took that to mean that I was somehow manipulating him into being with me? I really don__ know if I__ looking too much into this message. To me it is gaslighting and manipulative. He is trying to tell me that I said this to him exactly and he is manipulating the situation by painting me as the manipulative one?"
emotional,I (22F) am concerned about my relationship with my partner (24m),"_I met my fiance two years ago and things were great from the very start. I was drawn to him because of his looks, his sincerity, kindness, and how well we seemed to compliment one another. We had similar goals, beliefs and ambitions. He was gentle, focused and made me feel so loved and appreciated in a way I had neglected to feel in other relationships. He had a great relationship with his family and friends, nice job and seemed like an overall great guy. I was sure that I wanted to be with him from the very first date and apparently it was mutual. His family ended up loving me and his friends did as well. We were THAT couple that just worked so well and had everyone envious. I opened up to him about things I had never been able to open up about before, and I felt content and loved in a brand new, unconditional way. It felt like every failed relationship and every heartbreak had led me to him. He was my solace, my comfort, my best friend. He was everything to me and I was everything to him. We rarely fought, it was beautiful.  __Our relationship was great for about the first 6-8 months. After that is when things started to go downhill. Randomly, he began to accuse me of cheating and became very domineering over me. He would obsessively check my location and go through my phone often, even after finding nothing he would still be accusatory and threaten to end the relationship unless I begged him not to. I have never cheated on him, let alone anyone ever, and I have always been exceptionally good at making sure his boundaries were communicated and respected. I have few male friends, few male coworkers, do not follow any men apart from my close friends on social media, and have always been a loyal partner yet he would still find new and creative ways to accuse me of cheating. He explained to me that this insecurity stemmed from his ex-girlfriend cheating on him four years into their relationship and it has made him paranoid about our relationship ending the same way. I said I understood because I had been cheated on before as well and made an effort to be more accommodating. He would insist that I sleep with the lights on while on FaceTime so he could see where I was and that nobody was with me. I always complied even if I was frustrated, yet if the call dropped or my phone died he would blow up and accuse me of sneaking another man in. He began asking me to have a baby with him to ""prove"" my loyalty. When I adamantly said no and went on a more effective method of birth control he was livid. Things like that went on for months until he randomly dropped it. Almost like he lost interest entirely. And it was calm for awhile after that.  __Shortly after our one year anniversary I ended the relationship. I felt very disrespected by his actions on social media (liking thirst traps of girls he knew, having VERY close friendships with female friends, lying about not having past intimate relationships with those female friends, etc) Immediately after I broke up with him he began hitting on my friends and hooked up with a girl __o get back at me_ and __o get my attention._ Why I took him back I still don__ really know. It was evident that the relationship was toxic but I guess I just didn__ want to lose him. After all, we__e all done things we regret right? All I knew was that by this point we were engaged, we had a life together and had made so many good memories together. I romanticized it and I missed the fleeting feeling of being loved by him to the point where I became extremely depressed and anxious without him. I__e never been a codependent person before. I__e had a handful of heartbreaks before but nothing like this. With every other past relationship, even the ones I was really hurt by in the end, I was able to move on and heal with relative ease. I__e never been the type of person that has felt like I needed a man. But I felt powerless without him. I don__ know. Regardless, I took him back under the guise that I was just being insecure and needed to work on myself so our relationship would grow. I invested in therapy and tried looking retrospectively at myself to try to combat my own shortcomings and not get so __orked up_ over girls in the __ast.__  __It was around this point when his ex-girlfriend contacted me. She let me know that he had actually been the one to cheat on her, and it had been a pattern with him and his ex girlfriends for years now. I wouldn__ have believed her if she didn__ have so much intimate knowledge about things I had been lied to about or not told. She had proof and gladly showed me. She brought light to a lot of things that I was unaware of, BIG things I was unaware of. She didn__ contact me to __et him back,_ or have any malicious intent, she made it very clear that she resents him for all the hardship that he had put her through and that she was messaging me out of concern. I believed her. I still do. She is not the villain that he made her out to be and I feel so guilty for blindly taking his word. I confronted him about his lies and he broke down crying, saying he was afraid I would leave him if I had known the truth about how he had treated women in the past. I probably should have left right then. But hey, hindsight 20/20.  __Once again, (shame on me at this point I know) I overlooked it. I moved on, trying to make it work because I truly do love him so much. But about six months later more severe problems began to arise. He began exhibiting very bad anger issues. He would begin screaming at me regularly, calling me deplorable names in fits of anger. He would very often call me a __tupid bitch,_ __poiled bitch_ and __hore_ amongst worse names. He has broken shelves, cabinets, handles, video game controllers, doors and has punched holes in the wall. He slams doors often and screams at me so loudly the police have been called by neighbors before. At this point we were living together so I could not escape it. He would get irrationally angry if I wanted to go anywhere by myself, or with friends or family. He stopped going to work and pawned my belongings, including sentimental gifts he had gotten me. He began drinking more which I believe exacerbated his anger issues. I would have left if I was not so concerned for his mental health. After months of this, he finally hit rock bottom and decided to seek help. He got on medication for his bipolar disorder, quit drinking and is going to therapy. However, I can__ see a difference in how he treats people. He is happier now which I am grateful for but still treats me along with his other loved ones like garbage. In a way I was kind of hoping he would go back to being his old self once he was more at peace mentally but I guess not. I don't know what happened to him.  __I don__ really know why I__ writing this or what advice I expect to get. I know it's easy to simply say __eave_ but I have built a life with him. We are supposed to get married. He knows me better than any person on this planet does and I still love him wholeheartedly. I know deep down that this relationship isn__ sustainable in the long run, but that just makes me want to cling on more. I recognize that what he__ done is irreparable but I don__ know how to change my feelings towards him or walk away from him like he is not still my person. I__ scared, I feel lonely, I feel isolated and frankly, I don__ know what to do. I feel like I__ in so deep with him there__ nothing for me to do."
emotional,"My brother is in an emotionally abusive relationship and I need him to know this, does anyone know of a good website other than the one provided on this page?","1. Threatens to kill herself  2. Puts him down and degrades his character 3. Calls him names 4. She has hit him before 5. Calls and breaks up with him over minor things. he agreed last night that they should break up, and she has been threatening him ever since. My brother is 23 years old and eventually  actually told my mom what was happening (we are studying from home) and its clearly quite bad as my mom said my brother needs to screenshot these conversations to ensure that if she ever follows through with any of these threats, he can show that he has not pushed her to do anything. He has shown my mom these conversations. 6. She threatened to call the police when he asked if she could please post some of his things to him, saying that those things were a gift and she is entitled to them  7. He has been respectful to her but she manipulates him into believing he isn't good enough  &amp;#x200B;  I need to send him something to him for him to realize he is being abused. He also I believe doesn't know how to get out of the relationship. I think he is 1. worried that she will follow though with those threats 2. degrade him to all of his friends who live abroad. (he has been finding it hard to adjust to life overseas without his close friends. he moved abroad to study, and since I was also living abroad, my family followed. We have both been home to complete our final year of university. His mental health has been up and down for weeks now and I think this is why. Does anyone know of a good questionnaire or something that I can send to him? He does care but hes letting her degrade him"
emotional,Help - is this manipulative behaviour??,"1.5 months after the breakup with my ex I am still left confused about some things that happened. I wonder if I am overreacting or whether such behaviours are really manipulative, and would be thankful to hear opinions:   \- lets say I have some insecurities/anxieties going on, and since I think about them, I become silent. My partner does not like the silence and wants to know what is going on. I do not want to talk, but he is asking until I give in and talk. He then is upset by my thoughts and a conflict emerges.   \- rushing through the relationship, and when I tell him that I get stressed by it, he calms me down, but at the same time makes indirect pressure, so I give in sooner or later. Example: He wants to be an official couple extremely fast, I say it is too fast for me, he then says that I should take my time, but also says that if we do not become official, ""we loose precious time"". I felt indirectly pressured by such situations, and since I was unfortunately a people pleaser in that relationship (I did not realize back then), I did what he wanted, I guess I feared that I loose him   \- running away from conflict so that I am alone suffering, because only in hard times like these I can develop myself (it stays with me a lot that he intentionally put extra pain so I can ""learn"")  \- after running away from conflicts each time, leaving me with unresolved issues, coming back whenever it fits him (I have to add that I did not reach out in such situations because I felt like leaving him alone when he runs away)  \- taking my issues personally (e.g. insecurities), even though I tell him he should not because I know it would happen with anyone, which is why I am working on it   \- analysing me due to my insecurities like a therapist, even taking other people into the analysis, like ex partner or parents"

emotional,ghosted after 10 years. Angry I can't just move on or not care (like he has) any advice or support would be great.,"10 year online friendship. We talked about every week. I tried looking for similar ghosting posts, but they're usually after dating someone for a few months or whatever. Being ghosted after 10 years just punches me in the gut. It's almost been a year since he ghosted me. He confessed about something he was keeping from me and then  blamed me for his actions. I know that's not normal behavior, but I at least wanted to talk it out.    I'd send messages asking what I did, why he woke up and hated me, etc. Those messages would also turn into pure frustration and embarrassingly desperate. But I realize that's what people are willing to do for those they care about. I'd ask how is it that I gave him 10 years of my life and he couldn't even bother giving me a simple reply. The most annoying part is he ""reads"" all my messages but refuses to say anything. I call and he hangs up. This is also why I believe it's emotional abuse. I assume he enjoys my desperation and agony at this point.   It honestly feels like a sudden death. But at least you know dead people can't respond. I still breakdown. I just feeling so disposable.  I feel like I did everything I could to try working it out and I just need to consider it a loss and move on. I'll go months feeling fine and then I'll just break down while running errands or something.  Tl;Dr how did you move on after a long-term relationship when the other person won't communicate? How did you feel worthy again. I know therapy is needed, but what can I do for myself now?"
emotional,Is this emotional abuse?,"18F. I don__ really know where to turn so I came to this forum, let me know if this is not allowed and I__l take it down. I started seeing my boyfriend 19M in June. Everything moved extremely fast and he told me he loved me very early and got very upset when I didn__ say it back. He moved in very quickly, kind of just sleeping over once and never left. Everything was good in the beginning until he started having these angry outbursts. One moment he would be fine, kissing and cuddling me, then he would either become extremely moody or would lash out and call me names. He has been extremely upset about money, that when I found out I was pregnant and went to have a blood test, all he spoke about was money and that I don__ make enough until I cried. The reason I didn__ have a job at the time was that I had just quit as I was leaving in a few weeks to move across the country. When I decided to get an abortion, he drove me, and wouldn__ speak on the way back besides from a few angry remarks. As soon as we got home, he drank himself in to the ground and begged me not to __ill it_   Later that night and the day after I had to comfort him whilst I was in extreme pain. However, he was very supportive and holding my hand and rubbing my back. I got a job a day or two after even though I didn__ feel fit. Yesterday however was the moment I realised something was wrong.  We have had loads of arguments in the car, most consisting of him screaming and me staying silent. He drove me to a covid site to get a test, he turned the wrong way and that__ when it began. He started calling me loads of names, useless, naive, and not self aware. He physically grabbed my wrist and pulled the sat nav quite violently in front of him. A while later, I explained to him that I was upset and he started laughing hysterically and had a mental breakdown in front of me. This has been the first time I have been scared of him and he apologised profusely saying he was abusive.   I don__ know what to do, I love him, is it abuse?"

physical,Healing?,"7 years &amp; it was over. He was a very emotionally mentally abusive person. Name calling, gaslighting, cheating, getting in my face. You name it. I forget the term but he would withhold affection from me &amp; sometimes not talk to me for DAYS on end if I didn__ want to have sex with him when he wanted.   What im struggling with now is just that. I have an absolutely amazing perfect new boyfriend. No person on this earth has ever respected me as much as he does but I always feel this obligation to have sex him if he initiates it. He in no way pressures me or gets mad/ignores me/etc if I do say no. But im almost scarred from my past. All these terrible memories rush back into my mind from my previous relationship. And I just end up saying yes."
physical,Worst night of my life.,"A few nights ago my boyfriend physically hurt me when he was drunk to the point where I felt in fear of my life (choking) that I called the cops. The whole experience was traumatizing. They took pictures of the bruises, I spoke with 50 different people about different things. (victim advocates, the court, the police, the works). My neck has broken capitularies on it. I have an appointment tomorrow with a DV outreach program.  Even though I asked charges to be dropped the state still wants to pursue it. They are holding him without bail. There is a protective order where he cannot contact me or my child. I tried to get them to lift it soley for phone calls but they would not.   I just feel so alone. He will have to wait 6-8 weeks for a bail hearing to see if they change their mind. He will be missing the holidays and our child's birthday. He is in jail. I know I was hurt but I feel like I ruined his life. If I left when I first started seeing red flags this would never have happened.   I will have to support myself, be alone, I just think back to all the good qualities he has and felt like I should have been more proactive about getting him help (therapy anger management classes). The worst part is how alone I feel. And the shame of this happening."
physical,Trying to heal,"A few weeks ago I left my abusive ex.  I still miss him so much but I am aware he isn__ going to change.  He tried to kill me a few times, broke my things, left me with bruises all the time, always talked me into having sex with him and always made it painful, called me every name in the book, cheated several times, and was mean to my cat.  I started therapy and was diagnosed with C-PTSD.   I guess I just don__ understand why I allowed this to happen for so long (year and a half).  There was several times I tried to leave but he never let me.  I had so many chances when I was home alone but I never even tried when I was alone.  He had me wrapped around his finger.  I honestly didn__ even take these things that seriously either, like I always thought they were fixable issues.  I didn__ really wanna leave him either, but I knew if it kept going I could end up dead.  He was abused as a child and has BPD among many other illnesses, I cared so much and gave him everything yet it wasn__ enough.   He was very very good at gaslighting my emotions to the point where I didn__ even believe things were that serious.  He would call me a __aby back bitch_ if I cried.  I feel like I__ still in this phase where I don__ think these things were that serious.  I__ still wanting to talk to him and possibly work things out eventually.  Is this something that__ normal?  One day I will get pissed about what he did, then the next day I think everything__ fine and we should get back together. It__ just a rollercoaster of emotions.  I__ not planning on going back right now or anytime soon btw.  (We have a 1 year restraining order)  I__ enrolled in college and it__ so fucking hard to do right now.  I major in psychology, which a big reason for that is because I wanted to understand him better (I__e also always found it interesting).  It__ honestly triggering for me to do homework because of that.  All I want to do is lay in bed all day and watch TV, but realistically I really want to pass as I am a good student.   I haven__ done course work for over 2 weeks..  I just don__ want to do anything anymore.    I feel like no one understands my pain unless they have been through it.  My family keeps telling me to go for walks and I__l feel better.  I don__ see how that can possibly help.  Even reading books like __hy does he do that?_ isnt helping me either.  I just don__ know how to get out this rut.  I miss having a boyfriend but it would be a horrible idea to hop into a relationship right now.  He got rid of all my friends for me, so I don__ have anyone to talk to besides my therapist.  Anyone have good suggestions on how to heal from this mess?"
emotional,Thank you for your support and advice!,"A few weeks ago I made a post asking for advice.  https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/r4uo21/can_a_person_stop_the_emotional_abuse/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share  I didn't break up with him then. But he did start reading the book why does he do that. And he's seeing what kind of abuser he is. He does own up to it.  Yet... I'm broken. Don't recognise myself. He has made my world dark and lonely. I need to reclaim the person I am.  So I ended it. The day before Christmas eve.  He's devestated. So am I. He broke us. He destroyed us. And for some reason I still love him and wish we could still be an us.  So the journey continues. He has told one of his best friends, and his own father. They are both shocked. They don't recognise him the way they know him. His friend want to help him. To help adjust his mindset.  His mindset is coloured by ocd and general anxiety depression. His thoughts spin out of control. And he does understand that his treatment of me isn't good. He is waiting for treatment to start mid January. And he's ready to win over his struggles.  Meanwhile I'm trying to find joy without him through my days. And trying to find my self worth and trust that I can make my own decisions through my days."
physical,Moving away vs staying,"A month ago, I got my abusive husband out of our home. I finally opened up to everyone how bad it really was, and now everyone is pressuring me to move for mine and my kids safety. I admit, I do not have a Lot of support here, but I have a job I love, a house I love, and my oldest is in kindergarten at a school she loves. I have an offer to move to my best friend, 3/4 of the way across America, but I just don__ want to. Everyone is scared that there will be a murder/suicide, or something like that the next time he loses control. My head knows moving would be safer, but the thought of it makes me sick. What do I do?"
physical,Did I do the right thing?,"A new couple moved in across the hall from me last week. The woman is very sweet, very friendly, and introduced herself to me when I saw them in the hall when they were moving in. He was kind of rude and standoffish, but I didn__ think anything of it at the time.   A few days ago, they were coming home, and I heard him being an ass hole to her. That bummed me out, of course, but I don__ know anything about their lives, so I tried not to judge too harshly. From the conversations I__e had with them, I really got the impression that he is a very stereotypical redneck white boy that thinks VERY highly of himself.   Tonight, though, I was walking my dogs and I heard him SCREAMING and clearly heard him say, __ou fuckin_ bitch! Yeah, what?!_ Followed by a pause and then, __et up!_   I started to think about my own experience with abusive men, and how I would have liked to have someone check on me back then, so I called the police and reported a possible domestic violence incident. I asked them to please just check on her to make sure she was ok. Was this the right thing to do?"
emotional,Do I leave?,"About a year and a half ago I realized my husband is verbally abusive and manipulative (as much as it breaks my heart to say so).  This morning he got angry at me, came towards me in the kitchen, took the broom from my hand and his body pushed me over. All the way down. In front of our two kids.  He has apologized for coming towards me and for knocking me over. He knows it__ wrong and unacceptable.   What the hell do I do?"
emotional,How do you co-parent with an abuser?,"About two months ago I had enough and called off my marriage. We have two small children (5 and almost 3). Problem is that he__ so miserable that he will angry text me for hours at a time. If I don__ respond (even to tell him to stop) he will go on indefinitely and it continues to escalate. I block him on and off frequently. Tonight I signed up for a coparenting app where the messaging there could be viewed by a lawyer or mediator if need be. We have resolved most decisions about financials, initial custody arrangements, etc. But something will go wrong in his day and he will just turn it into a tirade on me. It mostly happens via text but also with nonstop phone calls and in person when he sees me. He is unemployed and trying to find a job so that he can move out. I have a very demanding job and have to put my phone down, hide alerts from him, even though I need my phone frequently at work. How in the hell do I co-parent with a monster? And how can I live with one for the next few weeks or months?"
physical,Is raging at someone considered domestic violence?,"Advice / venting   Basically about 1 year ago my mother decided it'd be a nice idea to full blown rage at me in the car while I couldn't escape on the way to work (we work together).  It's only when I am mad/angry with her about her going  fuking against me and encouraging my self absorbed sisters ways.  This has happened twice in the last one year and her voice cracks and she's violently mad but didnt hit me...yet I felt like she deff wanted to if that makes sense?  I would move out at the drop of a hat IF I could yet I am stuck working in the family business and no money saved, cant afford rent and have no one in my life to be with me through my tough times. In amidst her rage she called me a bad daughter amd to grow the fuck up lmao!  She also never apologized and the second time she raged it were standing in the door way of my room so I pushed her as I felt she were going to attack me. I hate everything and most importantly I hate her for this and wont ever forgive her unless she randomly and miraculously apologized for her wrong doings. Ofc she carries on to encourage my self absorbed  22 year old sisters ways and is going over to the family my sister ditched us for again for the second time tomorrow. Yet she expects and wants me to move with her and live with her ?? Ewww I am only doing it cause I have no other option and if I met a sugar mumma tomorrow I'd leave the fuckers in the dust.  Amen"
physical,There__ nothing left you can do to me,"After - beating me - destroying my things - telling me all the time that I__ a bitch - telling me I deserved the abuse - yelling at me literally until I broke down - telling your friends and family how crazy I am   Lots of women lose their job recovering from DV_ I didn__   Lots of women lose faith in romantic relationships ..: i haven__   Lots of women lose their self worth and confidence_I still love myself  Once the memories of you have faded away, AND THEY WILL, I__l only have left the new strength and confidence that at this point NOTHING you or anyone does is going to take me down.   But nice try ___"
physical,MY ABUSER PLEADED GUILTY AND IS IN JAIL,"After 2 years of living in constant fear of my boyfriend of 8 years and the building of worse and worse abuse he nearly killed me. I was in the ER 2 days, got an emergency protective order, my parents took me in, I bought a new car, quit my job. Uprooted everything. Changed my life for the better. After nearly 2 years of waiting HE PLEADED GUILTY. HE IS IN JAIL.   I have never felt so safe since this happened. After the incident,I put cameras all over my house. Motion sensor lights inside and outside.   I just got the call from the DA. I feel so free."
physical,Giving up on my best friend,"After 8 years of watching her get physically abused 6 of them spent in front of her young children and I__ not talking shoving, she__ had numerous black eyes, as well as concussions, she is partially deaf in one ear from having her head slammed on a tile floor, as well as being choked to the point of blacking out. I__e helped her get away financially, helped her with two separate injunctions, was there when she actually did finally get the police involved when he attacked her in the bathroom when she was hiding in there with her kids and both her and her 5 year old daughter were injured.   She was able to get into a beautiful beachside condo but yet she still spent the better part of the year fighting tooth and nail to get CPS out of her life so she could return yet again because she missed her family. They went to court today and had the no contact order dropped and it__ right back to square one. She admitted everything to me yesterday and spoke about how he is being awful again but will never be able to get away because she loves him too much. It__ even more painful because I am very close to her children, they__e spent a lot of time with my husband and I. My heart breaks that this is what they will grow up in and there is nothing I can do to change it.   I__ three months pregnant now with my first child and I have to focus on my family. Right or wrong I__e expressed to her that there is nothing else I can do, I have no more advice to give. She will have a moment of clarity and then it__ right back to being her fault as well as mine for insisting that she got the police involved when her daughter was hurt. That really hurts to hear.   I guess I am just venting more than anything. I__ sorry for anything that comes off as cold or offensive. I don__ mean it to, this is just really hard when you care about someone and over and over you watch them get destroyed. I just truly feel like there is nothing I can do to help. When we talk she wants me to justify his actions and I cannot and she gets upset with me. I appreciate you all listening and for any of you going through it I pray for your courage and strength to take care of yourself."
physical,positive feelings,"After I left my abuser after 3 years I realized something. I wasn__ allowed to have friends, so any time we had a party or anything it was people for him. Everyone came over just for him, never for me. That always made me feel so isolated, until now. I had a room full of people there just because they were friends with me, I didn__ feel excluded for the first time in years. For once I felt like I wasn__ isolated and these friends knew about what happened and I__ so grateful for this. I think this is the best feeling I__e really had since the end of everything. Restarting my life felt so hard but I__ glad to finally feel happy again."
physical,Order of protection,"After my ex tried to strangle me, slapped me, and ripped my clothes off to take sexual pictures of me to send to friends, the same day I was granted a temporary order of protection. I am not able to change the locks tonight so it will have to wait until the morning. Since weapons were included in the incident, part of the order of protection was that all of his guns were to be turned over to the police instead of his friends or family. Instead of waiting on him to do it himself, I decided to take the guns to the police station myself to give him even less control over the situation and keep everyone safer. I also took all of the valuables out of the apartment in case he decides to make a midnight run to the apartment. He currently has warrants out and will probably not be returning but until I change the locks, I  wasn__ taking any chances. He messaged me through a third party before the TPO begging me to drop the charges and how sorry he was. He never thought I would fight back as I have. I__ still terrified. I__ scared and feel guilty for having the warrant served but I know I__ saving my life and another woman__ or his sons life. I am not going to stay alone in my apartment until the locks are changed and he is in custody. Although with my order of protection, it doesn__ matter. As soon as he violates it, he will be arrested. Despite that, I am still scared. I love him still. But you don__ trust someone you love like that. Stay strong. I have had nothing but support from friends, family, the domestic violence center, and the police officers."
emotional,Leaving my parents house,"After years of living in an insanely toxic environment and having my first taste of living in the outside world (first year college student), I__e decided to leave my parents house for good.  When I came back home for the summer, I was hoping things would have changed with them, but they didn__. It__ only been a month and I felt like all healing progress I ever made in college has been destroyed. I want to heal again. Seems like the best way to do that is leave the situation.   So if anyone here has any tips or pointers that would help, I__ really appreciate it.   I__e only been 18 for two months so I__ a bit terrified and not quite sure what I__ doing.   Feel free to comment or PM. Either works."
physical,Happy Parenting Day,"All mothers, fathers, everyone!! I love you all and I am SO proud of you all. We are all in a different place in our journey, some of us are able to help others, some of us are trying to survive. In all of us I__e seen the same dogged, steely determination to save our children, or their children, or those kids down the street. Celebrate the Mom you know!! Some of us don__ have a __raditional_ mom. Found families are the shit!! Anyone, male, female, nonbinary can be psychotically protective of children or vulnerable people in their care. Your mama can be a 300lb biker from Maine or a 90lb girl, I don__ care. Whoever fosters nurturing and protective love, with a side of kickass, thank them today."
emotional,What to do with all the love?,"Alongside the emotional abuse was a lot of love and happy memories and an integrated life. I am not forgetting the awful things, but the wonderful parts were there too (I don__ just think it was a trauma bond) and I am devastated to be losing this person and the good inside him. I don__ know how to give up this love and the yearning for things to be different. I have been sobbing every day for a month. The grief is consuming me. What if this was the only kind of happiness I am meant to have?"
physical,My story,"Am I allowed to tell my story here?? I am trying to be open and unashamed, but it__ so hard to find my voice. It__ bad. There__ physical, threats, all sorts of things. I feel sick thinking of it"
physical,Feeling really hopeless. I keep trying to leave,"And failing.   He's become a very powerful man during our marriage. His family and friends are very powerful people with a lot of pull. Of course I had no clue when we got married. I've witnessed their corruption and I know they have no problem hurting innocent people to further their agenda. I discovered that he's a member of a dangerous organization, hiding millions of dollars of assets while I can't pay bills, participating in so many illegal schemes. He has financially destroyed me, stolen my money, destroyed my credit, to where I worry constantly about just keeping the lights on and he is so wealthy. I fell for his threats last time and took him back because I was so afraid when I found all this out.  I witnessed him do something similar to a ""friend"" of his recently and it was terrifying how similar it is and how proud he is to use his power to hurt innocent people. He owed his friend money and instead of paying his friend, he used his connections to try to ruin this innocent person's life.   He's threatened my life, threatened to do awful things to me, and I know he will and it feels so hopeless. How can someone who's just ""ordinary"" fight someone powerful? The ordinary person never wins. He's tracking my phone, having people keep tabs on me, who knows what else. And I know it's true because he'll drop hints at things he should have no way of knowing. He has so many powerful connections and his subordinates to do whatever he asks, and legal connections to protect him when he crosses the legal line. I have no one and I know they will make up false allegations.   He hates me for existing.. he hates me with such a passion for just not hating myself as much as he hates himself, and its terrifiying. My crime today? Asking him to stop calling me stupid..now I'm being threatened, he's knocking doors down, he's acting bizarre and insane... all because I dared speak out. If I voice any disagreement it's fair gsme for him to terrorize me for speaking out..  I'd love to hear some kind of hopeful story of a small person taking on someone big but I know this is a battle I won't win. But at the same time I don't think I can keep living this way. Just him raising his voice gives me nightmares about his rages for days and I live in fear walking on eggshells near him."
physical,Anyone whose entire family ignores d/v at hands of your spouse? For decades?,"Anyone else whose entire immediate family ignores the domestic violence/ abuse at hands of your spouse?   Anyone experience this for decades? Excuses made on his behalf or family asking how you are,  but ""please don't mention xxxxxx, I don't have time for it now"". ""Don't tell extended family about xxxxxx"" ""don't ask for assistance from them or it will make you look bad"" ""don't tell your doctors what's going on at home or it will make you look bad and you could lose custody of your xyxyxy"".   Meanwhile, he's nearly killed me 3 times. Hospitalization and everything... within the last 30 days. I pleaded with him to stay home and, drive me to Er. He refused. I pleaded the next day, but it was too late, I needed an ambulance.  He's cost me my ability to have more children. He stole my ability to walk without pain &amp; a cane (that was another 3 surgeries). Had a rib removed after 18months of mindbending pain and he refused to attend any doctor's appt with me, but 1 pre-op.   I've stopped talking to my immediate family. I just can't take their wilful ignorance anymore. It hurts my heart.  Maybe he doesn't scream ""you b1tch!!"" in my face or leave bruises on my body all the time (anymore), but he's done more than his fair share of life ruination. I once earned 100k and was very successful in my career. Now, I am nothing but someone who gets yelled at.... by our xyxyxyxy as well as my spouse.   Where should I move? I'm thinking ID, MT, or maybe CO.  Thoughts?"
emotional,Confused.,"Apologies for this being long. This is the most confusing relationship I've ever had and I've lost friends and family due to it. I have been involved with a man for going on four years. Despite many red flags and questions in my mind about possible emotional abuse and controlling behavior through the years, we recently got married and moved to a different state. I moved away from my adult children. I left a job I had been in for nearly 25 years. I know this sounds incredibly stupid, but he has many good qualities that confuse things for me....then there are nights like last night.   We recently moved to a house that needs renovation. It was a strenuous and stressful multi-day move and we're still lacking hot water, so we took a hotel room for the night to clean up and do some laundry. I encouraged him to get into the bath, which helps his aching knees and back, and I set out to do the laundry on a lower floor of the hotel and also make dinner in the kitchenette. He soaked in the tub and I checked on him occasionally. I intended to take a shower and relax after the laundry and dinner were done, but was pretty busy taking care of those tasks, and while waiting for laundry cycles and in between cooking tasks, I read a book while he soaked. Laundry done and dinner ready, I asked if he wanted to get out. He refused to speak to me, refused to eat the dinner I made, got out of the tub and went to bed. Total silent treatment. I continued to read and just let it go. He left the hotel in the early morning, without a word to me. I stayed at the hotel until checkout, then went back to the house. He was there, sitting silently, drinking whiskey. I gathered up a few things, not feeling good about staying there, and he accused me of having his wallet. I didn't, but I did explain my actions... that I was taking care of tasks in the hotel to help him. He accused me of making him take a bath, leaving him there for ""4 hours"" so I could play on my phone (he frequently accuses me of cheating so that's probably what he thought I was doing). I told him I was only reading my book in between tasks, but was really trying to take care of him by doing the laundry and making dinner while he relaxed.  He then launched into my chewing nicotine gum (I picked up a minor habit of this a few years ago and do it off and on...coffee doesn't perk me up but the gum does and we were driving long distance so I thought it'd help me), calling me a drug user, so he obviously went through my purse when I was out of the room (he has many times gotten into my email and done other snooping). I'm just dumbfounded. I truly was trying to treat him to first use of the hot water and relaxing while I made dinner and did laundry. Somehow I deserve being abandoned, getting the silent treatment, and being called a drug addict? I'm now in another hotel, alone, trying to decide about driving back to my home state. He raised a fist to my face before I left so I don't feel entirely safe being there. Just about all my belongings are there at the new house. I'm 1700 miles away from my adult children and other family. Maybe it's just stress from the move? I'm confused and totally embarrassed. I don't have anyone to turn to. Is his behavior emotionally abusive? Why do I feel so guilty when all I was doing was trying to be helpful to him?"
physical,Today marks 5 years since I left.,"April 1st will forever be a day burned in my memory.    It's the day the lightbulb in my head finally lit after 3 years of emotion, verbal, and physical abuse. I was done.    My abuser was my (now ex) husband. An angry, jealous, narcissistic a** hole. I'm proud of myself for leaving when I did. I'm certain that if I had stayed much longer, he really would have killed me like he threatened to do so often.    Sometimes I still experience flashbacks and panic attacks at certain triggers. But I've gotten so much better because of therapy, and my wonderful new husband.    I want you all to know, that it does get better. You deserve better. You are not what they say you are. You're worth everything this world has to offer you and don't let anyone tell you different.     I literally got on a plane and flew about 8 states away to be rid of him. I never spoke to him again after telling him that I would be back. I knew I was lying when I said it, I was so afraid he would see through it and not let me leave. He almost didn't, but his wonderful Father called the police and then told him they were on their way to come arrest him. That finally made him run for it, and I escaped.    I took out a protection order and had divorce papers served to him. Without the help of the people who supported me, I don't know if I could've done it. There were so many sleepless, tear filled nights. But I did it. I got my life back. Sometimes I feel like I don't deserve the happiness that I've gained now. His lies still echo in my mind.   "" You're worthless. No one wants you. No one even likes you.""   ""If I hadn't taken pity on you, no one would've ever married you.""   ""You're ugly, stupid, disgusting.""  But they were all lies. All false statements to make him feel better about himself. Because his own precious ego was all he cared about.    You are worth it. If you can leave, do it. The sooner the better. There are people who love you, who care for you. They want you to be safe. I want you to be safe.    Thanks for being there Reddit. I mostly just needed to talk about this today, and you all know more than most what it's like."
physical,Online support groups?,Are there online support groups for survivors? I'm feeling really mixed up and I think it'd be helpful to talk to other people who've gone through similar things but I'm not having much luck finding any groups.

physical,The gaslighting is killing me,"As a victim of violence, I feel like I__ at the end of my fucking rope. Someone; just FUCKING LISTEN?!  In 2017, I (21F) was in a domestically violent relationship for 1.5 years.   It started out absolutely wonderful and he (23M) was everything I could have wanted and more in a man. We moved to his home town together and within 3 days of moving the abuse began. First, it was being slammed into a wall and choked because I didn__ hear him when he asked me to move whilst he was moving a bed. He begged and pleaded for me to stay.  I grew up in a DV household and my mother once told me don__ ever end up with a man like your father. It__ funny how we say __ know_ and when we__e in that situation we suddenly don__ know how to leave.  Christmas Eve, he became so angry that I wasn__ drinking with his friends that he punched me in the face and gave me a black eye. He demanded I go cover it up with makeup , but everyone sitting at that God forsaken table saw it, and not one man.. or should I say boy had the courage to ask him how the hell I got it , or what the fuck he had done.  Over the next year and a half, I was choked, punched, kicked til I was black and blue whilst having to work 38 hours a week whilst he sat at home and did nothing but game.  On his 21st birthday, I left him. His best friend told me should he ever put his hands on me again that he would remove him from his life because his parent were the same way. What a fucking joke- they__e still friends 2 years later.  I took all my photographic evidence to the police and all I was told was __orry, nobody saw it happen and you didn__ report it at the time so we can__ do anything._  I sat there and I fucking cried , I cried because I felt like he won. We ended up seeing each other again for another 4 months after that, and he punched me in the face again. That was the last time.  I learnt last year he had a new girlfriend and I thought maybe I can do what his ex did for me at the time and warn me. What a fucking mistake. I__e been painted out to be psychotic, obsessive, and I__e had defamatory statements made out about me by the both of them and today was the last straw.  This girl ran to me when she felt he was going to hit her; she asked for my number when she felt threatened and abused. And I called a welfare check on her because I was terrified he had done to her what he did to me. In the end I was just __he crazy ex who was trying to get him in trouble with the law_  I suffer enough with the C-PTSD I have by being beaten by him for a year and a half. Today, to be accused once again of being psychotic , delusional and the crazy ex .  And I am fucking tired; I am tired of the post traumatic flashbacks, the lack of justice, I__ tired of not feeling heard.   And people wonder why victims of violence don__ speak the fuck up."
emotional,Only a newly wed. Telling husband I want to leave,"As far as assets, children etc go, there won't be much drama there. There are no assets and I'm still pregnant. He's seen how reasonable I am in/out of court.  I just need support. I have 4 children now and have to live with the stigma of 3 BD. I'm extremely embarrassed. I am a relatively intelligent person but I'm also far too caring and patient with the wrong men.  First BD started off well. I was 17 and he was 20 (I know that is not ok in some places, but where I'm from it's legal to be involved with anyone, at any age, from age 16). He got me pregnant. I gave an ultimatum (I'll abort if you leave me). He chose to stay and relocated us. Once his dad calmed down, we were all excited.   However, that's where the issues started. He had cheated on me and got another girl (my classmate) pregnant. He denied child was his and abandoned her until she asked him to take a paternity test. After that he was so flaky with child and I started becoming very controlling for him to 'man up' to see his son. I stuck it out for 3 years until I couldn't take it anymore. I felt suicidal.   After that my life was a mess. I had no life skills, no income, no mental stability, no support network.   I started dating 1 year after our second child was born (I thought first child would need a sibling).  Almost every guy I met started being abusive. I'd pick men of different backgrounds, race, etc to find out they were controlling or lacked emotional regulation skills.  I met a guy who seemed very sweet. He was smaller, looked younger and was quite meek and polite at our sports club (martial arts, who would have guessed...). I knew what to look for in an abuser so I was good at cutting a guu off early and ghosting if I saw a red flag. Long story short. I went through 4 months of hell, but also had the best few months in terms of gaining meaningful employment, meeting my fitness goals etc. I was being paid $1200 week from job/tax benefit/CS so I had to move out of my statehome (into his). This was far too soon. He sexually assaulted me into getting pregnant. He knew I would get pregnant. He used threats/coercion by pushing me outside and saying ny kids and I would sleep in my car if I didn't follow his sexual 'law.'  I am a natural minded person (naturopathy etc) and I found enough support to not go through with abortion. I was helped by a refuge into a brand new home, lovely furniture, found a support worker etc. By this time I found social workers to visit every week, draw up safety and custody plans etc. I was diagnosed with PTSD and attend counseling.  Stupid me. I have a lot of unmet 'inner child' needs because my mother left me as a baby. I received very little nurturing as a kid. That often leads people into addiction. I can admit I had a love addiction, even if I was trying to be very safe. A love addiction put me into unsafe environments. I feel miserable and lonely if I'm not dating. So I met someone while pregnant.   He was very intelligent (so is his dad and he is a multi millionaire because of it). He had moved to my country because of his own abusive ex. He was very like me in values at first. He said all of the right things about healthcare, being a good role model, fitness (he is a talented athlete) and he was so understanding of my situation. We landed in trouble when I noticed he was quite high strung, sensitive and emotional at times.  I'm cooking him dinner and he has a freak out because I flipped salmon on the skin side to sear it. He quickly flips it back over.   He's never done this to me personally, only at a situation, a mess left, something out of place etc. He's very sweet towards me but will yell/scream directly at dishes in the sink.  With my kids is a different story. He started emotionally abusing my kids. I have tried everything for him to stop.  Yesterday was the last straw. My daughter was choosing her chips as she normally does out of a large packet. He started screaming and shouting at her, shaking the bag etc over choosing chips? What colour to get? I watched in horror and she started bawling (she is 7, mildly autistic btw). I intervened immediately.  After most incidents I usually sit down with him and explain different methods. He's read a parenting book and an emotional abuse book. He went to counseling but it was more of a box ticking exersize and they offered him only  4 sessions.  Yet he still bullies, gaslights, interrogates, does 'tough love,' and insults my kids. If they're upset he jumps right into that storm with them. When my baby gas cried as an infant, husband is yelling 'shut up c**t! as an expression of anger.' He swears and shouts a lot.  Last week I had written him a letter to see if that would help. Each time he is always remorseful and so upset to see me cry and hurt. He starts highlighting his parenting  book. He goes to work miserable and sad. He's never turned on me for labeling his behaviour as abusive.  Last night I cried until midnight. This morning he is asking me to help him change and telling me he will. I don't believe it. Tonight I'm telling him it's over.  Allowing him around my children when I've seen no improvement is complete negligence on my part.  I'm not going to cope when he is gone. I'm living in a poor area, so seeing a single mum in a state house is the norm. I'm so heartbroken and angry that he has put me in a position, because our relationship without kids is emaculate. We solve conflicts so easily and we are so intimate and vulnerable with each other. We've had a lot of fun together.   We still have to co-parent together. My next step is to stop my love addiction and never date again until my children have grown up. I will try an addiction program or get my counsellors help.   Thank you for reading this far __"

emotional,I'm the emotional abuser in my current relationship | seeking advice,"As the title implies I am the emotional abuser in my current relationship and I have realized that my actions have really effected our relationship  The actions I did before were being neglectful, getting angry at the little things, and when I'm angry I tend to put it out on her, I would also blame her for absolutely nothing , guilt tripping her, coming up with half baked promises, persuading her to do things she doesn't want to do, I constantly victimized myself, when I ask for help and she helps but I dismiss her help and become unappreciative   After all that she gave me several chances to prove to her I could change and that she won't regret decision, and all those previous chances I have room for granted because I was reckless.   Back before I didn't really know my problems, I did for some but not all. But after she told be this was the last last chance and told me the full extent of my actions towards her which lead me to my realization of my mistakes and my wrong doings.  During my realization I got to understand why I did those things and why  I was so blind at the things I've done and now I am gonna make things right. She even told me about the ""cycle of violence"" and it made me open my eyes more  Right now I have a different perspective in life, not asking the ""why things happen"" but the ""how to"" or ""what can I do"" to properly approach the situation  and make amends. I did say before to her I would change but I rushed it, not knowing what I did fully and not being able to see and feel in her perspective.  As of now I am doing my promises to show that I am changing. Not rushing this time which I am not used to yet but will do. But because of my previous actions towards her it made her doubt me, thinking that there will be nothing she can gain from dating me and having second thoughts about giving me another chance which is completely understandable because of what I did.   I have done some small goals and continuing to finish them to go to me big goals. I've been reading about articles similar to my scenario, gotten familiar with the cycle of violence, understanding my emotions and controlling them, took time to reflect and understand each and every mistake I did, and how they affected her and my big goal is to be a better person for not only her but to everyone around me.   What can I do to help better myself more, any tips on how I can improve as a person?"
emotional,One Day...,"Asleep in the snow is where you found me. My body blue from either previous abuse or the cold, you couldn't tell. But you picked me up anyways. It was then, you said, you saw the contraband in my hand. You still took me in. You fed me, you cared for me. You treated me as if I didn't have long left but you would make it the best last few breaths I would take. And to your surprise, and mine, I pulled through. And the months to come were beautiful.  You restored my faith in humanity. You renewed me. You gave me a new purpose, breathed life into me where previously, I had withered away. The blackness I had found myself residing, you simply turned on a light and renovated the world into somewhere I didn't feel lost but felt home in. The months to pass were beautiful and ours. We went on adventures I never knew could exist. We explored places that went long untouched by man. We walked through life as if if was just us and no one else on Earth. And for me, it was just us.  I cleaned and danced until you got home. We stayed in some days, went out on others. We had dates, we danced in the rain, we took on the world. And then, the most beautiful of all things found us. Inside me, was a seed that would forever shape who we were. And unbeknownst to me, change who you were. As I slowed down and our little fire grew, our fire between us began losing oxygen. I found myself gasping for breath desperately physically and emotionally. The adventures stopped. The paintbrushes we used to shape the life around us began collecting dust. Our way of life became a memory that at the time, I didn't realize I would miss so horribly. The honeymoon was over.  The storm came inevitably. The waves crashed over me as if to drown me and sink me. And after swimming for so long, I didn't realize I was sinking. It began getting easier to just let go. As I sunk, the flashes of our world overwhelmed me. Memories of someone else I thought was me became almost unfamiliar. That can't possibly be me, could it? It's completely different than the world I live in now.  As if on cue, the world we built fell like the fake rooms on a stage. That's all it was, that is all you built. I was too encased to see it. The room is fake. I never left the blackness. It's still here. Around me. I never escaped. I never will. I'm panicking. I thought I escaped. I don't want to be back here. I want to go back to the world we made. I don't want this! **I don't want this. NO! SOMEONE HELP ME! I DON'T WANT THIS! NO! WHERE IS THAT WORLD!?** ***I CAN'T FIND HOME! SOMEONE HELP ME! I'M BACK HERE! NO!***  ***Breathe.***  I couldn't believe it at first. I refused to. I asked you for roses but you picked them yourself. Sweet. You never took off the thorns. Bittersweet. You took me to a stage I thought was real and had me believe in. But eventually, you have to get off the stage. You can't act forever. Otherwise, you wouldn't be acting. And a lot of people remember the characters more than the actor behind them. And that's what you did to me. I remember the character.  So there I am. Our fire breathed it's first real breath of oxygen. And my fate was sealed. Your name was etched onto the permanent scroll that connected me to you through our fire. And that was it for me. I knew then that this was my life now. I felt my fingers touch above the surface for the last time. I sunk into a cage at the bottom. And when I tried once to swim out, it shut. You as it's guard. As my guard. Imprisoned by false memories. Imprisoned by the hope I will get to see you act one more time. Just one more time. Just let me free one more time and I promise I won't ever ask again.  No matter how far out of the cage I reach, I will never again see the sun. I will never feel it's warmth. No one knows I'm down here. No one knows how many bodies there are begging to be found, to be solved... on the ocean floor. All I can do is reach and hope one day... one day I will be free.   My name is Lauryn and I am a victim of emotional abuse. It has been three years since I have been free and I have at least five years left before my escape plan will work. It will be at last five more years until our fire spreads large enough to be on it's own. Until then, I will keep reaching. One day I will see the sun again. One day..."
emotional,"""Your response was worse than your father's""","Background: I'm currently 16 years old and I don't have a job yet. My parents and I were having dinner together after a trip to the mall. While eating my father decided to drink some alcohol before the conversation started. He was talking about me staying at his house until I get married. This was before the real argument began.   Story: my father asked me if I'd buy them a million dollar house in the future. I just responded with ""I can't get you something like that if I can't even figure out what career I want. I'll be willing to help you achieve that goal but I can only do so much when I become an adult. My father wasn't happy with that response and he started to hammer down at me that I can just get him a house like that in the future. He eventually told me ""You know what? You don't need to buy me ANYTHING! Don't even give me a single penny!"" At that point I was upset since I knew he was trying to guilt trip me or something so I told him that I'll go downstairs to eat.   At that point my mother came down stairs to tell me that my dad was just joking around and he only wanted to know how much I loved him. Apparently I was supposed to say something like ""oh I'll buy you a 2 million dollar house!"" I told my mother that I didn't understand that he was trying to say and that I just understood it in a more realistic way. I didn't want to lie to him about something I wouldn't be able to promise or grantee to achieve. My mother just kept on reiterating the same point over and over again until she told me ""I thought your father was in the wrong but your response is worse than his. You should have just understood that he was joking and that he just wanted to know how you felt. You know when you were a kid you would have said 'I'll buy you a bigggg house' and how all the sudden you stopped? Honestly you can't take a joke? He just wanted to know if you love him. You know that your father tone would have came out wrong since he started to drink alcohol"" I told my mother that I'd be willing to pay for any financial, medical, or any other issues when they need help but I know that I won't be able to buy a million dollar house. She told me that I was over reacting and told me to stop crying over such a small argument.   Idk after that I just went up stairs and cried for a while. Both of my parents didn't check up on me so I just took a shower to calm myself down.   Main question:  ~ was I in the wrong?  ~ was my reaction excessive? ~ should I address my feelings and point of view to my parents again explaining how I misunderstood? Maybe I can better explain my point to them since I've calmed down"
emotional,Is this abuse? Have I been blind this whole time?,"Backstory- together for a year, moved in together at 9 months. The relationship was never simple. During the first 3 weeks there was red flags. He wanted to surprise me with food, I ended up guessing where we was going and he got so angry, got out the car and kicked the curb and refused to talk to me. He said he felt disappointed in himself for not doing good enough and hiding the surprise. He moved into a place in August 2020, 2 months after we started dating. I went every weekend to stay with him. I dont drive, so I would meet him wherever he was working in Central London, or I'd travel 1.5hrs on public transport. We had an argument probably around October time, and he told me he wants someone to cook for him and take care of him and I don't do that. So every weekend I cooked from scratch, bought the ingredients, cleaned his place top to bottom. He fell asleep early so I'd stay up til 1-2am cleaning. There was a couple of times I didn't want to cook, or clean. And each time he would just break up with me.  Things got better around January time, by March 2021 he wanted to move in together. So we did. Within about a week he started saying the constant company was too much, how he liked his own space etc. We had an argument on his bday due to him going out with friends after I told him I had a whole evening planned for him. I packed up some things to go back to my parents and in anger threw a pair of jeans across the room, in a different direction to where he was. The next day he called our estate agent and told them I was unsafe, abusive and had physically hurt him. He told them he had to get out the tenancy and tried to force me to hand my notice in, 1 month into a 12 month lease. Eventually after 4 days he came home and realised I wasn't giving in and he claimed he wanted to get back together. 1 month later, on my birthday, he was going out and I asked where to, he then ended it with me, claimed I was controlling and that it was the worst day of his life meeting me. I touched his arm to comfort him and to apologise for making him feel like that, and he said I had touched him without his consent and that it was abuse.  He moved out, took everything and left me alone in the flat we shared. I was devastated. I then found out he went out my birthday evening and took condoms with him. I begged, pleaded and cried for weeks. He ended up blocking me and giving me ultimatums such as 'hand in your notice and we can talk' etc. Over time, things got better, but for 2 solid months he was so nasty, wouldn't speak to me and it left me feeling close to ending my life. I'd never felt so low. Being ignored and being refused any closure or explanation was so so difficult. He seemed fine and almost as if he was getting joy from this. In August after ignoring him for a few days he came over and since then we have been having sex. The tenancy ended in September and we live separately now. We have seen eachother twice and he seemed ok. However things got heated and he started saying really intimate things, wanted to record during sex. I was confused and questioned it. He is now angry with me, has said he wants to stop seeing me, but we can 'still talk as friends'. I have messaged him and asked if he really doesn't think we will see eachother again and he has been online all the time since the message was sent 24hrs ago and he has point blank ignored me. Why can I not get over him. The thought of him with someone else makes me feel so so sick. Being ignored by him ruins my day and I sit wondering why I'm not good enough"

emotional,Was this emotional abuse? I just wanna figure out how to heal from this,"Bit of background information before I begin, I can__ put too much because I know he__ on Reddit. We were on and off for nearly a decade, our whole teen years. We were officially together for 5 years and only broke up once in that time just over a year ago, I just recently ended things for the last time. We were in a LDR for about 2 years. I only really truly realised how bad he treated me until after I left. (Apologies for how long this is gonna be but I__ really appreciate the help)  Some of the stuff he would do was -   - knit-picking me constantly.

It made me feel very small and stupid   - refused to spend time with my friends and family. Every time I would ask him to do something with my family/friends he would say no. I think for the entire relationship he only had dinner with my family 6 times and went out with my friends and I once. All those times I had to beg him to agree. Once telling me never to ask him again because it was horrible and boring. If we spent too much time talking with my family before going to my room he would have a go at me because __ came here to spend time with you, not your family._  - would do things that made me feel uncared for and stupid. He would keep walking if I was tying my shoe lace, walk off if I was talking about something he didn__ care about and leave me sat by myself. Would make jokes at my expense in front of his friends. Sit on his phone for hours ignoring me, turning his back on me in bed. Tell me I talked too much and I quote __idn__ need to open my mouth everytime there was a silence_, told me I cheapened saying I love you by saying it too much (that one really hurt) , tell me he was deleting social media and trying to use his phone less when we were long distance. You get the picture. - refusing to compromise ANYTHING for my needs. If I bought up that I was feeling unloved, he would kick off and tell me that nothing he ever did was good enough for me so I would never ask again. He would refuse to FaceTime me most weeks whilst he was away, when I asked if we could set aside half an hour a week to talk properly he said __ell why don__ I just drop out of uni so I can give you attention 24/7_ I always ended up apologising even though I was the one giving my everything to him and getting nothing back. I would ask to go on dates, the answer was always no, even though I offered to pay everytime. Didn__ matter how much I wanted to do something, if he didn__ want to it wouldn__ happen.  - put everyone else in his life above me.

I quickly realised he was actually just embarrassed of me because his house mates were all rich and middle class, I am what would be called a council house chav. He would never say no to anyone, but his answer was always no when it would come to me.  -would make me chase him. He had more self discipline than me, especially when it came to our relationship.

physical,Help and advice needed,Can anyone give any advice on how to get over a abusive ex boyfriend? We was together for 8 years and although we had an amazing relationship I would say on average he would get violent with me around once a year and evertime he strangled me. Since reliasing I am a victim around a year ago I have been building up my strength and recently came to the conclusion that this relationship needed to end. Since breaking up with him a few days ago he's signed up to therapy and it soo nice to me. Im struggling to know if I've done the right thing or not. I know the relationship was abusive and I was soo unhappy but I'm wondering if I've made a mistake. Any advice needed please....
emotional,Coming to terms with having an emotionally abusive mother,"Can anyone relate? Does anyone have advice? Does it get better   I__ a female adult in her 20s that moved back home due to Covid last year. It__ been difficult to say the least. My mom has always been toxic and I think I__e known she__ emotionally abusive my whole life but I__ at my breaking point right now.   For context, my dad suddenly passed away several years ago so that was a traumatic event that can f*ck anyone up. Losing a spouse isn__ easy but honestly my parents fought a lot my entire life. My mom yelled at my dad and verbally/emotionally abused him while I was growing up. After he passed she had regrets but still acts the same way (only with me now).  She is generally kind and we have a fun time together but she gets triggered and completely explodes on me daily. She will tell me I__e changed and I__ not the same sweet girl I used to be if I defend myself. She threatens to kill herself because she thinks I don__ treat her with respect. She constantly wants to control my life though I__ a grown adult (tells me what I shouldn__ be eating, how to dress, how to act). Worst of all, she always compares herself to my boyfriends mom and tells me I treat her like trash compared to how I treat him and his family. She guilt trips me constantly for not watching tv with her or talking to my long distance bf on the phone before bed.   Tonight was the breaking point because she raised her voice and yelled at our dog. I went to her room and asked her not to yell at him because he is innocent and wouldn__ understand why she was yelling at him. She turned it on me and said I raised my voice at her, threatened to kill herself, told me to leave her alone and never speak to her. Anytime I try to talk something out, she__ dismissive and just gets quiet and makes mean faces. She cries as if I did something to her. I__ so tired of it   I get sad because I don__ think this will ever end. I feel like she will always have this cycle of bipolar and emotionally abusive behavior. She would react so negatively at any recommendation to seek help.  Does it get better"
physical,new relationships,"can we just acknowledge that after being in a dv relationship for so long and the rewiring of my brain that i struggle so hard to tell what i can be mad at and what i should let go of in my new relationship.   like after i have time to calm down and think, a lot of things that i now snap at are things that i shouldn__ have been mad at.   i feel like my mind is still in her hold sometimes and it__ scary cause we haven__ talked in months but when i snap at him, i feel im back but this time im in her shoes and he__ in mine."
physical,Am I going to get hit?,"Can you guys please help me_. I__ feeling frantic right now so I__ probably not gonna word this the best but I__ just gonna spit it all out. I also have a five-month-old baby and he__ probably gonna start crying for me soon so I got to make this quick. I__ going to be very honest and vulnerable here. Please try to refrain from judging me. I am 29 years old, a woman, and I have been married for a year and a half. Me and my husband got pregnant a month after being married.  I found out when my child was one month old that my husband had been watching porn our whole marriage and before even though I said I wouldn__ date him unless he quit and he told me he did.  He was looking up prostitues in the area when I caught him.   Anyway, I have PTSD from previous rapes and trauma from my abusive father, and when I go into fight or flight mode, I fight.   Last night, my husband said something about the porn that I misunderstood but it triggered me really badly and I actually thought we were going to get divorced because I thought he basically wanted porn more than me.    He came into my room and I told him I was feeling extremely angry that he needed to leave and that I wanted to hit him. After saying to leave  about 15 times he wouldn__ go and in the past he would grab my arm and stop me for leaving or follow me wherever I was going and not let me lock myself in the bathroom. I felt trapped angry and overwhelmed and I stood up and I pushed him and scratched him and screamed at him to leave. I know, completely unacceptable behavior. But he instantly shoved me and I flew back onto the bed. He got on top of me and grabbed my arms extremely tight and screamed in my face.  I eventually put my foot on his chest and push him off me and my foot slipped and pushed on his face and he tackled me and put me in a chokehold and covered my mouth with the blanket. I panicked and fell off the bed and he let me go.  He knows I__ claustrophobic.I have bruises on my wrists and my arms today.  My shoulders feel strained and sore and my lower back hurts probably from being thrown.   About 10 minutes later I was peeing and he came and stood in my face and screamed in my face and I felt like he was going to punch me. I told him to go and he was scaring me and he eventually left.    I know I was physically abusive but I__ wondering if you guys think he__ going to hit me one day.   Other warning signs I have seen are him violently screaming some times albeit rarely, getting in my face acting like he wants to fight, he shoved me on the bed another time when I got up and angrily walked up to him and he said he thought I was going to try to fight him, and when we used to play fight he would leave bruises on me and be too rough and didn__ seem to understand that he couldn__ be so rough with a woman.  He also has been physically aggressive with our dog sometimes and makes her yelp from grabbing her scruff too hard."
physical,Feel like it's my fault,"Confused about what's going on in my marriage. My husband doesn't get physical often, but he has on occasion and it's mostly if I try to leave during an argument or set boundaries. If I don't do either of those things then he doesnt get physical.    If I'm cuddling with him and for whatever reason I get annoyed over something or we get in argument and I try to get up or leave he grabs me by my hair or pulls me down by my hair. Once I stop trying to get up or leave he stops. The same if I try to set boundaries and tell him that he can't pull my hair or grab my hair that it's unacceptable. He gets annoyed and mad over that and says I'm always trying to be combative and then grabs my hair just to show me he can? Once he grabbed me by my hair and pushed my face into the couch and just held me there until I agreed to stop bringing it up when I tried to talk to him and told him that he needed to stop. It didn't cut off my air and I could still breathe when he did this and he's never taken it that far again but it was terrifying and I cant get that moment out of my head.    Part of me knows what he's doing is wrong but another part of me feels like it's my fault? If I stop trying to get up or leave during an argument then he doesn't do anything and doesn't touch me or if I just dont bring hair grabbing up to him. When I've tried to tell him it was abusive to do that he got annoyed and mad and emphasized that he's never beat me or hit me. Idk what to do or how to stop feeling like I'm the cause of this like if I acted differently then he would also."
physical,Feel like an abuser and need advice,"Confused on a situation but also want to make amends  I have a situation that i__ not sure how to feel about. For context, i am a woman and my ex is a woman.  We broke up a month and a half ago. We started establishing boundaries to not have sex or be physical, which made me bummed out. It was really hard for my ex too but she was trying to be the strong one or else we would stay __omplicated_ as opposed to being totally broken up.  First 2 weeks We would still hold hands here and there, cuddle, be touchy, i__ sleepover but not have sex. We kissed about 3 weeks later on a romantic boat ride. Later that night she got black out drunk with her friend and looked wt me and just kissed me, without asking, not really romantic in anyway and she was like __hoops oh well._ I was mostly surprised and just thought she was drunk.  Next morning she was still drunk til about 2pm the next day cuz she drank so much. The whole morning she was talking about how much she wanted to have sex with me on the beach, how horny she was and to take her to the beach. I took her to the beach but I told her we cant have sex because she was still drunk and we just gad coffee. Anyways she kept going on about having sex for a couple hours and i kept saying no. Eventually the alcohol wore off and she was just hungover. Later in the afternoon we go back to her house and she was still hitting on me. She said she was sober so i said okay and we had sex. It was good, complicated feelings after bc were exes. We had a little romantic day trip the next day. Generally flirtatious. We were really close though after the next week, talking all the time there was a romantic spark. She felt sad about how we broke up and dont work.  I come over friday, we drank and i spent the night. Didnt have sex, just fell asleep together. We were cuddling and romantic that morning.  Later she texts me saying shes sad and we need physical boundaries again and maybe shouldn__ hang out.  The next day we hang out, get breakfast at the park. Shes touchy and flirtatious again, holds my hand, puts her arms around me and caresses my legs. We decide to drive to a creek and she is continually flirtatious, she smacked my ass a t one point because we were being sexual and flirty. We were drinking again too. When we got to the creek we took our clothes off to go in and still touchy. It was really isolated and we were close to each other, i asked if i could go down on her and she was telling me she was really turned on but we shouldn__. It will make things too complicated between us. I was like we had sex last week things are pretty much already so complicated. I kept saying it wouldn__ be a big deal and she kept saying no and that we need to be good since we broke up. So she got upset with me and said i was pressuring her and i felt really bad and i said i was sorry. I gave her a hug and told her i understood but she was upset and i told her we dont have to be sexual and sorry for pushing it.   Week goes by. During the week i went out one night and got harassed/sexually assaulted by a girl. She wouldn__ stop grabbing my ass, smacking it, touching me  all night while i tried to move away from her. eventually she grabbed me by the crotch from behind me really hard. I was really upset and disturbed from the situation. I told my ex about it.  I sleepover at my exes again. We watch a movie, hold eachother while watching the movie. We go to a museum together the next day and she holds my arms and we hold hands the whole time. We later go to a pride event and get pretty drunk.  As were leaving the pride event, we were gonna go dance before we left w a group of people. We decide no. Then when were alone away from everyone she starts grinding on me. I was kinda i to it but also kind of triggered from the assault. I kind of stop her and look into her eyes and she was looking in mine. In this moment i just wanted to feel special and important to her, not like a sexual object shes grinding on. So similar situation happened as the creek. I asked her if i Could kiss her and she was like...no...i dont know we need to be good. And i was like i really want to...we were just dancing and stuff. And she said no its going to make things complicated...and i was like its complicated already were so touchy, we went on a date...i won__ be weird i__l be totally cool if we kiss. It felt like a flirtatious back and forth. She said she wanted to but she didn__ know. In my head i thought we were being, close, intimate but messy exgirlfriends. She looked in my eyes and was like __ou wanna kiss me...okay come here_ she started making out with me and pulled me closer. After we kissed she walked away from and said __hy couldn__ you just treat me right when we were together..._ and i said i was sorry...i know  We walk back to her car to go get food. She realizes she lost her phone and starts FLIPPING out super angry. (Side note, shes bipolar also was having gnarly mood swings all day and warned me) i told her i will help her, i try calling her friends. She wants to use my phone and i said just let me log out of instagram first and she gets angry i want to do it myself, she calls me sketchy and angrily throw my phone at me and it hits the side of the car. I get upset and tell her were broken up its just my personal things.  She storms out of the car angry and i dont know what to do. I call her friend, friend doesnt have phone. She gets back with her phone, i tell her i talked to her friend and she gets EXTREMELY angry and asks why would i do that and that i embarrassed her. She starts saying the only reason she lost her phone was because of me because i made her kiss me. She said i was so creepy and weird and so angry and it was all my fault. I was so hurt and confused. She said she wanted to be alone and i was trying to calm her down so we could talk because i felt so sad and confused. She screams at me more and storms out of her car. I learned when does this not to go after her. She then calls me screaming that i was __olding her car and things hostage because i wouldn__ let her be alone_ and i told her she stormed away after just screaming at me and i just waited for her. I also have no way to my own car? I come and get her and shes furious. I get out of the car and told her i would just walk and she yells at me more to get back in so i do. She continues screaming at me about how fucked up and creepy i am and i start getting so upset after the entire situation when i was trying to stay calm and be cool. I start getting angry and yell back and tell her that shes fucking crazy, to leave me alone and never talk to me again. I felt like she used an intimate moment between us as an excuse to take out her anger on me i was so hurt and upset. I started getting out of her car yelling at her as i walked away basically saying __uck you you__e a crazy fucking bitch, suck my dick and leave me alone forever_ she comes out of the car after me as i was walking away and she goes __OU WANNA FUCKING GO_ and i just was in shock. She shoved me to the ground and my head hit the ground. She started kicking me repeatedly. She then got on too of me and started slamming me to the ground repeatedly until someone came outside and stopped her.  So at the end of all of this i was really hurt and triggered from the violence. I am a domestic abuse survivor from a previous relationship which she knew about. We talked things out after this, and I completely apologized for not respecting her boundaries. I told her I sincerely thought we were having an intimate, but messy flirtatious moment together when we kissed.  I told her how i wanted to feel special to her not a sexual object and was still hurt from being sexually assaulted. Regardless she held her view and said i was being a __apey creep_. And i deserved to get beat up by her. We kinda have chalked it up to that... i feel so bad and terrible. I am trying to make amends with her and have told her i promise i won__ ever cross any physical boundaries with her ever again. I told her my boundaries were different if she ever was trying to kiss me like that i would never call her a creep or beat her up. She is a sexual abuse survivor so i know that plays into it.  Honestly at the same time I__ seriously unsure of how to feel about all of this. I__ deeply sad i made her feel uncomfortable and pressured i would never want that... i told her me wanting to kiss wasn__ necessarily even sexual and that i thought she really did want to kiss me but was trying to not make things complicated and she was sparing my feelings. What do you guys think?  I__ really sad. I also want to make complete amends with her and want to know from others how can I make amends with someone who is so close to me and I care for deeply. Any input on the situation is welcome. I know its a lot."
physical,Options?,"Context/Background: Late 20's female. Married almost ten years. No children. Currently, breadwinner of my household, as my spouse is back in university full-time. Since he's in school using the GI bill, he receives a modest monthly housing stipend. But, in a nutshell, I pay all the bills, as I make a fairly hefty salary. We are also homeowners.   My husband has never physically put his hands on me, but the verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse has been ongoing for about six years now. Spouse also has *intense* anger issues. Although he hasn't physically hurt me, he has gotten physical with things/items; he has thrown food at the wall, broke the porch gate out of anger (slammed it so hard the latch broke), has smashed + broken about 4-5 phones by throwing them against the wall, etc. On one occasion, he flung the gate to our neighborhood dog park gate so hard that it did bend/hit my wrist, but I don't know if I'd necessarily count that as 'physically' abusive.   Curious what my options are if I decide to leave the marriage. I don't know how much more pain I can take. Since I'm the breadwinner of the household, I'm curious what my legal and financial obligations might be. I know that, in divorce, the breadwinner/sole income earner is typically required to pay alimony to the non-earning spouse, or to the spouse earning limited money. Does the same concept apply in cases, where, the breadwinner is the victim of DV? Would the DV victim, even if they're the household breadwinner, still be required to pay alimony to their abuser? I understand that proof and evidence of abuse would likely be essential to the conversation.   Thank you in advance for any feedback."

Now he's saying I was being coercive because I threatened to call the cops on him. It came up the other day and he characterized it as the only reason he left the house was because I threatened to call the cops on him, but I don't think that's what happened?"

I miss his expertise at fixing things."
emotional,Why is it so easy to empathize with the abuser?,"Day 2 of living away and not together and it__ gone from __**k him, he did this on purpose_ to __t must be trauma, is there more I can do.._. This has been the HARDEST thing to sit with and I hate it so so much. Any tips? I have kept and look over mean text messages but damn it__ hard"
physical,Unsent letter to my abuser,"Dear ex,  I just want to let you know I__ doing fine without you. I want to let you know that I__ much happier since you__e been gone. I cannot tell you the agony, pain, stress, control, mental breakdowns, fear and sadness I used to have I thought it was normal when I was with you. Now that I__e been away for over a month I__ starting to really see what is actually normal. I__ actually learning how to love myself, care for myself, and actually have peace.  No amount of sorry can give me back the two years that I lived with you. Our whole relationship was a lie. I cannot fathom what kind of a person who thinks it__ OK to control someone, take them away from their family, and scare away friends so you could have me all to yourself. Then you want to go and play victim saying that I__ the one that abused you.  You constantly put the fear of God in me, trying to get you out of my house was like a miniature Trump kicking, screaming, constant temper tantrum__, and threats of destruction in my own house. Knowing full well the police can__ do anything. You exhausted me to the point where there I felt like I couldn__ fight anymore. I felt like I was crazy and I was close to even just committing suicide to get out of there because I truly felt there was no way out.   You tried to say that I was MRDD, schizophrenic, manic, etc. was all a lie. If you knew the half of what I deal with and understood what mental illness was you wouldn__ have been demeaning like that. You only said it so you keep me under control and to demean which hurt me in the worst way. When I found out you had cheated on me it woke up the dead me I thought was gone. It had motivated me in such a way that I knew I had to get rid of you one way or another and I realize you had taken so much from me. And I was not going to tolerate that disrespect, degradation, and pain that you continued to give me.  I cannot thank my landlord enough for helping me out and giving me a 30 day notice at my request so then it can make sure that you got out too. I also cannot thank my family that came through as well as my domestic violence agency to fund me to move across the country.  Ever since I have been away I have been a thriver. I refuse to let your toxic presence to continue to be a part of my life. I refuse to go back and reach out to you. Because I know that__ what you want. You want the attention at the cost of my soul. But the soul is not yours. You don__ know how to love you don__ know how to be there for me except to take and destroy.   Educating myself showed me I am stronger than you__l ever be. With the support of my family and everything I__e gotten back on my feet. I got a better job than you__l ever know. I actually met someone but we__e taking it super slow because obviously I still have issues to work through. Someone that actually respects me. Someone that won__ put their hands on me in that horrible way you did to me so many times without consequences.  I am also in therapy not because I am weak but because I am strong. I was strong enough to get through everything you gave me and more. No one can destroy me again like you did. I will never ever let it happen. I have you to thank for that for making me a stronger person than I can ever be. My past decisions will not be my future. With time, patience, self love, and boundaries I will be a new better me than I ever was before when you met me. You will never get to meet that new me. I refuse to be just a survivor I will be thriver as long as I live.   Sincerely,  Me"
physical,still living with someone who hurt me badly,"Describing my situation with some (very brief) details of the violence:  During a fight at the beginning of the year, he nearly suffocated me and gave me a concussion. There hasn't been any of that type of violence between us since then except one time after a verbal argument, where he more or less said, 'I want to do that to you again but I won't'. I've moved in and out of the house since but after experiencing worsening PCS (post concussion syndrome) symptoms am now back again, trying to focus on recovering some of my health which I've felt moving around so much has not helped me do. This is his apartment. Before I moved in, I was living in a rental that was affordable to me at the time, however, is no longer since I only just finished school when I moved into here, the pandemic had just started and am now still mostly not working and am still pretty sick from PCS (read as: I cannot afford my own place right now). He is gone a lot of the time (weeks at a time) and will continue to be until the summer, when he leaves for work for a full 3-4 months. I am in ongoing therapy and he has gone to a few therapy sessions that afterwards seems to give him a positive shift in perspective. I am pretty convinced at this point that I will need to leave the house and the relationship eventually. However, I also want to focus on doing the things that make me feel like I am on the right track for my recovery. And when I was moved out, I was really struggling with finding a situation where I could be more comfortable than I am here (sans fights). Right now, it honestly feels to me that I am in the best worst case scenario although I realize it is still risky. He did do me serious harm. He could have even ended my life. I don't think that is what he was trying to do and I also don't think he would purposefully do that, although of course I have read the statistics about abuse escalating. Considering all the pros and cons, I feel that for myself, right now, I am leaning towards staying (maybe at longest until the summer when he is gone for the longer period of time) and focusing on my health and recovery as being the best option for me.   My question for the community is:   If you were in my shoes, what would you do and over what period of time? I am looking forward to hearing more perspectives, especially given that I do, in fact, have brain trauma that is no doubt affecting my reasoning skills.   One more thing that I will add for those who have never had brain trauma before:   In my experience of living with PCS, it is like having a very strict limit on your energy level. It feels like I wake up with a set amount of energy to try to do the things I want to do, hoping that at least some of those things are what will eventually help me to make a full recovery and/or give myself an energy boost for upcoming days. I try to eat some brain food, do a couple social things, do some chores, do some exercise, enjoy some screen time, knowing that if I push myself too much in anything that I could bust and 'lose' the rest of my day. I'm finding that pacing myself is very important. A 'bust' may not be life threatening (as far as I know) but it has its consequences and sometimes I feel the effects of a bust for days, weeks. At least for me it is a big factor in knowing that if/when I do move out again, it will take a lot of my energy to do so.   Woof, I'm tired now. thanks for reading through! Hoping to hear some constructive thoughts!"
emotional,Was my aunt being emotionally abusive.,"Disclaimer: This is a repost over from r/adultsurvivors . It was brought to my attention this more of an example of emotional abuse than sexual, although there are some sexual undertones. This is a story of a grey area, with a female family member and me as a pubescent boy. It is not the most egregious story you'll ever read, but it deals with the subject of masculinity and sexual confusion from a straight, cis male child and now adult in his 30's. I have been aggressively told to check my implicit biases, misogyny, etc. Some of the hostility I believe I would've received no matter the details of this story, but it's noted. However, if you think by virtue of me being a straight, cis male I cannot be a victim of abuse, please click off. Thank you!  \-------------------  This is a question I've asked myself for 20 years. Was she inappropriate?  When I was about 10 my uncle married for the 2nd time. The aunt in question was not a blood relative. She was in her late 30's at the time. She was an attractive woman, and she knew it. For lack of a better word, she would ""flaunt"" it frequently. She met my uncle through a double affair they both were having on their SO's and ultimately their marriage ended with her cheating on him.  Around the time I was 12 or 13 and going through puberty (this is around the year 2000), when we would come over for holidays, she started coming up behind me and massaging my head as I sat at the kitchen table. She would wear these acrylic nails and use them to scratch my head and neck, and I would get an erection under the table. The oddest thing of it all was she would do this for 20+ minutes, not 3-5 seconds like when you lightly touch/scratch someone to greet them. This is an area with a billion nerve endings, and she was caressing and stroking, not doing deep tissue on my temples. Flat out, I believe there's no way she didn't notice that I was frozen solid, aroused, and very uncomfortable. Someone did not agree in the other thread, and pointed out women can cease to notice erections by simply not looking at your crotch. I understand that, but I'm telling you, she knew. Erections are embarrassing, obnoxious, and sometimes, impossible to avoid. Men's demeanor completely changes when this happens and we can totally freeze depending on the circumstance. It was a long time to sit there, essentially frozen and afraid to move, lest she see it and mortify me further. She was also 5'11 and towering over me, standing behind me.  She was new to the family at the time, and as I said not a blood relative, and for a young boy going through puberty having a relatively strange woman do this was awfully confusing for me at the time.  For 20 years I felt shame and confusion from being turned on by a __elative_. I wondered if this was incest. I have come to accept it really wasn't, and I am not to blame for simply getting en erection. It does not mean I ""liked it"".  But there's more to the story. By that point I hadn__ kissed or held hands with a girl. I was an obese, ugly teenager with acne and crooked teeth. I got teased mercilessly in middle school. But my aunt was be nice and affectionate...most of the time. She would also occasionally make jokes about my boyhood. Once I remember while she was putting on lipstick while I sat playing video games and asking if I wanted some myself. Once sneaking up behind me and putting a ""Birthday Princess"" crown on my head at my cousin's birthday party for a laugh. I__ be quietly minding my business, playing a gameboy, and not inviting her to make me the brunt of these jokes. One time she came and wrapped a pink Barbie pool towel around my shoulders. I was also reminded in the other thread that it's ""no big deal"" to put makeup or a crown of this sort on a guy. It's all in good fun. But on a 12 year old who didn't ask? Here I am thinking about this 20 years later...  One time when I was staying at their house, she conspired with my uncle to put on a mask, and jump out and scare me. It scared me to death. She'd then call me a sissy and a crybaby.  It never really went any further than this thankfully, but I actually still dream about it in my 30's. How this woman, a stranger to the family at this time, an attractive woman would play push/push and tantalize a teenage boy, and occasionally cross a thin line where physical touch became uncomfortable. It actually got to a point, I was so starved for attention, I would make an effort to be around her, I'd make excuses to go run errands with her alone. She'd touch my arm or leg ever so slightly. More than once, I even thought about asking her to dress me as a girl privately, as that would mean her undivided attention for at least an hour. I didn't start out asking for it, but in the end almost did. There have been studies and documentaries on how most serial killers were emasculated by a female authority figure (obviously going much further than this). This is a real thing toying with a boy's masculinity. And while I grew it nearly ""ask"" for it, she was the starting point. I can't help but wonder if she was grooming me for something more later.  Yes I've considered talking to a therapist, but I expect I'll be told to explore my sexuality and gender. I have explored the question thoroughly whether I am gay or trans. I am not. This was one instance where, at a time in my life where all I faced was torment, any positive attention even if it meant wearing lipstick and dress and being called ""pretty"", was better than the alternative.  We are still in a place in society where male victims of female abusers, though far more rare, are really not given the same degree of empathy. I faced more overt abuse from my grandmother would would beat my mother in front of me and once cut a shirt off my body with a scissor. If it's sexual in nature, the boy is actually congratulated. Both men and women can do better to not enforce this toxic masculinity."

You can also refer to my last post which describe a tiny bit of why I__ scared for my safety. I do not wish to get law enforcement involved as of right now being I have made reports in the past regarding my bio family and due to lack of evidence they would never really follow through with the reports. I also do not feel comfortable with law enforcement being I had past negative experiences and some of my bio family (abusers) work very closely with them. I don__ have much finance, but I have a lot of good work experience and currently work full time. I have decided to temporarily stop college because I have prioritized fleeing to a safer location. Most of my finances have been drained by my bio family (I had two wills written to me equaling around 150 thousand dollars, every dollar was drained and I never even knew about this until years after I was supposed to receive the money, apparently I signed the money over to my mother even tho I definitely did not). On top of that, my parents drained a lot of my personal money too awhile ago, and it has been exceptionally hard to recover from that. As of right now I am struggling a lot financially and don__ have many friends. I am close with the ones I do have but they aren__ in positions to help me. I also have family ties to Middle East, Central America, and east Asia (I__ withholding saying exact countries due to anonymity) and at this point I am willing to relocate (I__ in the USA currently). I am willing to relocate states as well. I just need options. I have stayed in in domestic violence shelters, as well as safe homes. They are all short term and they did help me find stable housing but they can__ help me find housing or jobs outside of my area, being that__ where they work within. I have also stayed in youth and teen shelters for periods of my and had really traumatic experiences in those. Domestic violence shelters and safe homes are a lot nicer but in my area there is a wait list and interview to get in, even if you were there previously, and they are short term (3-6 months). On top of that I would need to travel still for work and other necessities. At this point , fleeing my location is the only option I can think of. Does anyone have any type of advice? Perhaps a better forum for this question? I can afford a plane ticket/bus ticket. My credit isn__ bad. I can save for a hotel for a few nights in my location. I have most of my identification including a valid passport. I do not currently have a support system to help me through this.

physical,DV from a Child__ Perspective,"Domestic Violence - A Child__ Perspective  My dad is divorcing my mom after 25 years of domestic violence and abuse from her towards him and us kids. I always thought I had it worst out of my siblings. But realising that my dad truly had it worst is giving me emotions that I don__ know how to process or describe.   As the oldest child, my mom has put me in the middle of her and my dad. I quickly learned not to take his side. I thought I knew a fair amount about what was going on, but it turns out things were so much more horrific than I thought.  I__ truly appreciate some support / guidance for how to process this. Therapy is not an option now but I will try to make it happen eventually. I think I may be being too empathetic here, in that I__ taking on my dad__ pain as my own. The physical pain of abuse fades with time in my experience. What lingers is the fear, dread, uncertainty, hopelessness, shame, anger, tears, and just general shittiness afterwards. I know I have my own burdens to bear when it comes to all that. I feel terrible for my dad. I shut him out and took my moms side all the time. I took my anger from her abuse back out on him. Gosh that__ a shitty feeling, since he had it wayyy worse than me.   At the same time, I__ tired of knowing everything. I knew a bit about what was happening to my dad. I knew everything that happened to my siblings. All of this on top of my own shit means that I have a PhD in repressing shit. Internalising and rationalising.

I had been drinking with friends and felt stable enough to do it. I was in a good mood. Longest story short, he came over to my new place that I got so he wouldn__ know where I even live anymore. Now I feel like he tainted the __ersonal_ happiness in my home with visions of him being here. He came without question and we had the best time ever. Fell back into our __appy_ routines like nothing ever changed. We were up literally the entire night chatting, catching up, laughing a ton, super passionate sex. He held me as I fell asleep in his arms for a long time before kissing my forehead a few times and leaving and I think that__ the part that broke me. I woke up &amp; had left. Because we were never going to have our life back because it__ beyond remotely reparable.   The next day, I check his Reddit like an idiot. See he__ been in a relationship. But that he posted he regretted it with me. He said all kinds of abusive things. Pouring salt in old wounds. Lying. That was the hardest thing gaining self control over- not checking his social media anymore. It had been about two months since I had last checked but now I find myself constantly anxiously checking it again for no reason and it__ just hurting me.   I__ honestly so depressed I can__ even elaborate on what happened beyond that.   Now I__e been drugging myself back to sleep. Waking up panicked and sweaty. Flash backs to those first few months waking up heart racing sobbing because he wasn__ coming home. Because I wanted him to. I was in such denial, it took forever to  one out of the fog and get to the acceptance part of the grieving process. Now I feel all this time later I__e slipped right back into that.   I can__ for the life of me motivate myself to do anything. I don__ want to game. I dont want to watch tv. I don__ want to read. I skipped my second day back to work. I__e skipped job interviews I need. I don__ want to go to church. I have no desire to read the Bible anymore. I__e skipped showers and I__ days behind cleaning. I__e missed football. Today is a family members birthday and I would never miss going to visit. But I can__. I can__ even tell them Happy Birthday because I feel so guilty for not showing up when I know they need me. I don__ know how to respond to people. I__ in so much pain from spinal surgery yet can__ even drag myself up to go pick up my meds. I feel hopeless and I__ not doing anything to help myself. I__ just rotting away. Guess you know it__ bad when you don__ care wtf you__e posting anymore, you__e too weak to express yourself and don__ even want to hear from anyone because you don__ know how to even respond.  I was fine. For several months. I really really really thought I broke the trauma bond &amp; now I just want to rot away and die. Over one encounter. Don__ worry_.. I don__ have a plan. I just really wish I wasn__ alive anymore..  What I__ saying is. Don__ go back. It__ not worth it. It **never** is. They__l just move along leaving you suffering in some form or another and you__l feel that all the power you spent so much time taking back is stripped back out from under you leaving you defenseless, vulnerable and defeated."
emotional,Help how do I get back to normal,"Ever since I realized I was being emotionally abused and confronted my abuser (who I still have to see every week), I haven't been able to function. It's been two months since I confronted them but yet I still find it very hard to focus and to even keep my room clean. I feel like a slave to my phone and I find it very hard to not want to run away and distract myself. Is this normal?"
emotional,Concerned about extreme anger after abusive relationship,"Ever since my relationship ended last year, I have been having issues with anger. I have issues trusting anyone who I haven__ previously established trust with, so if I see someone I don__ know, I tend to think they are awful and going to hurt me with no evidence.   Every time someone vents to me about their problems, I become livid because my ex used to vent to me excessively, while threatening suicide. I remember she would criticize almost every aspect of my appearance, and she would get angry when I would fall asleep before. Most of the time she wanted me to stay up until 4am or she would scream at me. She would tell me I was silly for my own feelings when I would bring them up, but she seemed to be entitled to my sympathy at all times. She cheated on me and also sexually abused me.   When I see people I don__ know in public, I view them as obstacles and only people who would bring me pain. I wasn__ like this before. I used to be very compassionate toward others and help other people as much as I could. Now I have become withdrawn. I dislike being like this, and I wonder if any of you have also experienced something similar to this?"
physical,"It happens every 8 weeks, and we're halfway through week 7...","Every eight weeks, my husband is abusive. Usually verbal/emotional (I'm disgusting, I'm a miserable person, I'm a fucking bitch, etc), but sometimes physical (pushing, slapping throwing furniture, etc.). It's been 7.5 weeks since the last time, and I'm seeing myself detach and turn inward as a way to protect myself. It's this horrible waiting game. I just want to get it over with. I'm so unhappy."
physical,I NEED to talk but have no one to talk to and it's such a long story with so much explaining but I dont have the energy to put it all in this post.,"Exactly as title says. This past year I have been with my very aggressive and abusive boyfriend. Now I'm pregnant and about to have his child in less than three months and I feel so sick with myself that I am in this situation still, and also I'm so damn broken down I no longer have the energy to do a lot of things I should be doing... I need someone I can vent and talk to about all of the trauma I've experienced in this past year. I'm not even sure where to start with my story, theres literally time after time where I can tell you all about how he beat my ass so bad I got knocked out, or about how many black eyes hes given me, or about how many times I've had to give him head while crying, or about how many times hes slapped my $500 glasses off my face and how they're super glued together now and still dont stay on my face and I'm too scared to go buy new glasses because I'm afraid he will fuck them up too, or about how he fucking degrades me all the time, or even just about his aggressive attitude towards the world in general. I'm fucking terrified at this point. Hes threatened my life so many times and he knows where my safe spot, (my parents house) is... the other night I guess I felt brave and tried to stand up for myself when he said something bad about me, which resulted in him degrading me and telling me how he will kill me for hours until 3am. I'm so fucking scared to have this baby and that's even more heartbreaking to me because I've been through so many miscarriages and have prayed for a child, and now I finally have it and I still feel like I'm being punished for something... my hair is falling out from the constant stress or maybe from how often he pulls me by my hair, I have turned into a fucking door mat because most of the time if I just stay quiet he will stop, and I am just down right terrified of what's going to happen over these next couple of months. They say pregnancy is supposed to be the happiest time of a womans life but it's been nothing but constant stress, anxiety, and fear. My family knows what hes done to me in the past, and now, I keep my mouth shut about the things he does to me, out of embarrassment, shame, and fear. I feel like I'm about to explode from all the emotions and thoughts I keep inside. I can feel myself slipping deeper into depression and that scares me too because I'm going to be a first time mom soon and I dont want to be a bad mom. I wish I could've done better for my son. I wish I could've left and stayed away from him any of those times I did actually leave. I could sit here and wish about things all day but none of that is helping me. Why do I still feel attached to him in a way? Why do I fucking care about his feelings and how he will feel if I leave? Why am I so fucking scared to bite the bullet and leave one day? Do I really believe he will try to come kill me? Yea, I kind of do..."
emotional,Is __avior complex_ narcissism ?,"Feeling SUPER GASLIGHTED.    I__e been seeing a guy for about 4 months now who I noticed, every time my life gets tough, he pulls away, but shows up as the savior for multiple ex girlfriends drama /problems when they call. I was expressing my concern about a woman in particular, who is married , whom he used to sleep with AND live with (and her kid) _.she fell in love with him and then he left because he did t want to date her or be a father figure..  She ends up getting married and they make up and are __est friends_ now. they seem to have a codependent relationship with one another. I can CLEARLY see she is in love with him and also realized, he never mentioned me to her. He said her husband doesn__ care about their friendship, but I don__ think he knows they dated.  I__e also had mutual friends of her and I confirm they believe she__ still in love with him and also, she doesn__ know about me.  His response is ALWAYS __he__ happily married_ when I asked if he is positive there__ no unfinished business there_... Well, at 1 am the other night , she calls saying she__ getting a divorce. He LEAVES MY HOUSE to run to her aid. I told him he made me dismissed and it feels absolutely bizarre she would call him for marriage advice. He dumped me for __eeling threatened_ by her. Mind you, in 4 months, I never met this woman once. He also still watches her kid. When he answered her call, he said he was __t his homegirls house__..if she knew about me; why wouldn__ he have said my name?   Suspicious?  I__ so bummed our argument over this resulted in him leaving. It seemed to me like something that could be worked out.  Am I making a big deal out of nothing like he said? I need some feedback ."
physical,"My mother is domestically abused frequently, and I don't know what to do about it.","First of all, I would like to thank all of u for taking the time to help me.  I don't know what to do, I'm 21 and I live at home with my mother who frequently gets beaten by my stepfather. I feel like a horrible person for 'allowing' this.  I got into so many verbal and physical arguments already but it won't stop. I have been trying to seek help for so long, but the cops won't do anything, even though I have plenty of photo and video evidence, because they claim that he doesn't have anything on his criminal record.   The thing is, me and my mother are financially dependent of him, we don't have any family we can rely on so moving out isn't really a plan. I have tried seeking help already from financial organisations (I'm from Belgium, so in my case it's OCMW) but they won't help me.  I just want to know how I can get out of this situation, my mom doesn't want to live anymore, and I feel like a failure that I can't do anything.  I really want to move out with my mother and I want to live in a small appartment with her, but she refuses to move out because she wants to keep forgiving him and give him more chances.  I recently graduated high school so my plan is to financially support me and my mother after my graduation of university so we can move out of this hellish household, even though she doesn't want to, I would have the time to convince her, the problem with that is, that it will last at least another 4 years before I graduate university, and my mother definitely won't survive 4 more years of this hell. She's telling me frequently how that she doesn't want to live anymore and only doesn't give up because of me. My father is also trying to sabotage my school,because he knows that when I finish it, that it's game over for him and that we wont need him anymore.   If there are some people from Belgium, or some people who know a lot about this, is there any other financial aid that I can contact? Also what steps should I take to at least lessen the burden that my mother is carrying.  Thanks &lt;3."
emotional,Almost 2 years out of an abusive relationship and I__ still messed up. Wondering how and if it gets better.,"First off, I would like to mention that I__ on a throwaway account because my ex knows my main account so I may not check this for a bit after posting but I__l try my hardest. I (20s/M) was in a year and a half long relationship with a very manipulative person (20s/F). I lost my virginity to them and I__ starting to feel like I wasted that opportunity on her. I had a very religious upbringing so I was very sex-hesitant but eventually I was manipulated into sleeping with her, making me think that if I didn__ then we would have to break up. Ultimatums were very common in the relationship and were ultimately the end of it all when she gave me a deadline to move in with her and, with me in between jobs and with no real marketable job skills (at the time) I felt like I could not afford it and/ or didn__ want to take a demeaning retail or fast food job as my mental health was already deteriorated so much and between the job and moving in would have broken me emotionally at that point. The breakup will be two years ago this spring, so I__e been out of it longer than I was in it. I__ still feeling messed up about it.  Toward the beginning of the relationship I was on an antidepressant that lowered my sex drive. As such, I was not very into it and she was very much wanting it a lot more than I did. I even ended up switching medications at one point because of it despite the medication being great for my mental health otherwise. By the later end of the relationship, sex felt like a chore. I don__ believe I am asexual by any means but I just didn__ enjoy doing it with her. If I refused she__ get all pouty and then start being like __ feel gross and rapey for even asking_ and ruined the mood for the rest of the night as she wouldn__ snap out of it. Eventually I just complied more often to prevent this from happening. She even posted on r/deadbedrooms about it like it was my fault and made that known. (Which it was somewhat I suppose to a degree). As such, I still went ahead with it anyway and earlier tonight I started to think was this rape or something else? My thoughts on sex have seemingly yet to recover and with covid going on I__e had few dating opportunities anyway in the past year so I haven__ been able to test whether or not my actual sex drive is back to normal. That__ the first thing.   The second thing is my general self-esteem. While I__e always had depression and anxiety it definitely spiked during the relationship. Since then, a lot of the things she said about me are still hurting me. Even now, a lot of times I feel inadequate and self-conscious because what I choose to do would not meet up to her expectations. Some of these things are even outside my control but I still feel like an idiot about it.  I still miss my ex from 5 years ago because that was my last non-abusive relationship and I miss those feelings despite it ending with her cheating so I should definitely not miss her. I do not miss the abusive ex. I am wondering if these feelings are normal, and if not what I can do to help it.  Slight karma did catch up to her though. Soon after we broke up she caught an STD from her __ebound boyfriend_ that I__ pretty sure she just got with to mess with me anyway. They were together less than a month and she soon moved out of state after I didn__ move in with her. So I guess there__ that.  Wondering if anyone else here has gone through something similar and what you__e done to help better your situation. I was on antidepressants after the relationship and they didn__ really work. My current job also keeps me super busy and doesn__ allow much time to go out and get therapy. It__ possible, but not ideal time-wise."
emotional,Problems,First relationship. Went long distance after 1 month. Lasted 3 months after that. - Did not support me - Made fun of my major choice - Treated me being in boy scouts as weird - Stopped 1 on 1 time - Lied or maybe withheld truths (stories not consistent) - Constantly changed the date I would get to see them again then acted like I was remembering wrong (pretty sure she changed it depending on how horny she was at the given time) - Said I was crazy for saying she was special to me - Would tell me I__ annoying her or doing something wrong but wouldn__ tell me why or what - Would stop talking to me because they were annoyed with me - Had a dream that I cheated on them and then got mad at me for it and stopped talking to me that night - Constantly said I was overthinking - Called me obsessive and suffocating  Why do I defend this and why do I still feel like I didn__ do enough or was the problem?
physical,Could it be a one time thing?,"First time poster so sorry about the format. I just found out that my sister (30F) was head butted by her husband (30m) of 10 years. It was the first time they had gone out with friends in a while (covid) and they were both very drunk. They got into in argument and he literally head butted her, hard enough that she bled a little but not enough to knock her to the ground. She did call the cops and he got a temporary restraining order but she allowed him back in the house under the condition of not drinking. I feel sick to my stomach worrying about her but she said they__e talked it out and that it__ the only time something like that has every happened in their 10+ years of being together. She is giving him the benefit of the doubt of it being a one time thing that will never happen again but my guy keeps thinking about how dv victims think it won__ happen again. So is it possible that it could really just have been a one time thing where there was just way too much alcohol?"
emotional,I don't know what to do anymore,"For context family consists of me (28F), Sister (21F), Brother (13M), Mum (49F), Stepdad (mid 40's)   Mums first marriage (mines &amp; my sisters dad): physical and mental abuse. Though my sister doesn't remember it.   Mums second marriage (my brothers dad) : Emotionally abuse towards me for years and emotionally abusive towards my mum the final year of her marriage. His best friend also tried to secually assault me.  .....................  Apologies if this isn't the right place for this or if I've posted this incorrectly. I just cant deal with everything and im in the middle of an anxiety attack.   My mum remarried a third time, he is the one listed in the family members.  I'm at the end of my wits. I really have no clue what to do. For 2 years mums 3rd husband has been creating a huge blowout argument every month, its at the same time each month and if we ignore &amp; dont engage he will start yelling louder and louder he literally argues with the walls sometimes. He knows what buttons to push and eventually wears mum and i down until one of us engages to stop the argument.   I can't deal with it. I had a literal breakdown and ended up finding a therapist despite money being tight and future job uncertainties because all i wanted to do was jump off a bridge.   My siblings and i are all hiding in our respective rooms because he's currently arguing with mum again. She won't kick him to the kerb and i can sympathise with her and her reasoning.   I haven't moved out because of covid, job uncertainty and i know my mental health skyrockets when i feel and am alone. I also don't want to feel guilty about abandoning my siblings in this monthly shitshow.   How do i cope? How to i fix this? Working from home since march and my car being totalled in an accident has further clipped my wings i can't cope or deal with this."
emotional,Is it possible for someone to not know how to receive love after years of abuse?,"For example, can a healthy loving romantic relationship actually scare someone off, feel boring or just seem uncomfortable because, due to an abusive childhood, they associate love with pain? So a non-abusive relationship doesn__ feel right to them?"
emotional,Relationship with my wife is exhausting,"For most of my relationship my wife manipulated me into going to family gatherings every weekend. Her mother and sisters were manipulating her into going even though she didnt want to and in turn she would do it to me.  Her mother has borderline personality disorder.  If I didnt go she would start an argument and Id have a difficult time focusing on what Id planned to do that weekend.  Additionally she was very negative and would always force me to listen to her complain about drama at her work and drama with her family.  In addition to that we just werent getting along and she gained 80 pounds in a year due to being depressed.  I spent another 2 years doing everything I could to make our relationship better and help her out of her depression.  Then we split up for a month and she took our furnitute and moved in with her parents.   Prior to her moving out all my energy was focused on making the relationship less stressful.  I neglected my career and my health because I didnt have the energy to focus on anything but the relationship.  I havent been to a checkup or dental cleaning since the relationship started. For the first two weeks I started to feel like myself again for the first time in years.  I started working out a lot and improving my job skills and even started looking for doctors.  Then she started coming home on weekends and eventually moved back in without a discussion.  She said she realized how she was treating me after living with her mom again and was really sorry.    Since she moved back in things have been very different.  She's lost 20 pounds and actually listens to me when I tell her something shes doing bothers me.  Like she doesnt tell me about her family drama as often or divulge personal info in public to embarass me anymore.  She also hasnt left to go to her families house on weekends or pressured me to go with her as often.  But even with all the change I still feel drained when shes around. She still does some things that make me feel bad fairly often.  Like she will laugh at me in a mocking way and then say ""I love you"" very sarcastically.  If I ask for her input on a purchase she will say ""I dont care what you buy"".  If I try to go to another room from her to study or do something else she will pout or complain so we end up just watching tv all the time when shes home.  Shes on her phone the whole time but if I try to go do something else she still pouts and makes me feel bad about it so I wait until she falls asleep.  We live in a bad neighborhood and need to move. Ideally Id like to figure out what to do with this relationship before moving but I am struggling to make a decision.  I left my job to take some time to myself to figure this out but need to find a new one before I can move and havent figure out what I want to do yet.    Even while im not working I feel like I have very little time/energy to study and search for a job.  At first she was working from home part time and then finally went back to the office full time.  But she now comes home an hour earlier than she used to. I also sleep late since I stay up late so I have only 4 or 5 hours to myself when shes not here.  I saw a therapist for 2 months and she was focused on getting out of the bad neighborhood but didnt have any advice for my relationship which is the whole reason I hired a therapist so I quit seeing her.  I also havent been able to talk to my family or friends about this.  Ive tried but they dont seem interested in talking about it."
emotional,Ex/partner is actually making legitimate changes and it makes me more mad,"For the 4 years we were together, I never saw any effort to change or think about how he was treating me. He never seemed to care. Earlier this year, I asked for a divorce. Ever since then, he has been taking genuine steps to change. This was like 6 months ago or so, and while there *have* been some big slip-ups, it feels so different time.   I know everyone here says like __e__ just doing it so you__l stay and revert back to his old ways_ which I honestly want to believe more at this point, but seeing him make these changes makes everything more confusing.   Sometimes I see genuine change and sometimes I__ not so sure. I don__ know why it bothers me so much, and I guess I just needed to rant. I don__ know what to do. He__ determined to do marriage counseling and try anything to make it work."
emotional,What do I do,"For the last 5 years my SO has flown into full blown anger over every slight misstep I make. If I don__ do what she wants the second she wants, I spend the next three days to a week being told I__ the most useless piece of garbage on the face of the earth, often in front of my son. She won__ talk to me when she__ alone, but when our son is near she tears me apart and drags me through the dirt.   Over the years, I__e lost contact with all of my friends due to her fits of anger and jealousy, often because those very rare times I seen anyone else it took her off the pedestal for a short while. Eventually I had just stopped talking to other people, even family via text because it was too difficult to be dragged through the dirt because of it.  Every time I try to make a positive change in my life, like look at college courses, or changing careers, she hurts me in ways I never knew could feel this bad and it sends me right back to the bottom of the rut.   The last year I__e barely been coasting by, and I don__ know how to get out, I have no support network, I lost everyone."

emotional,"Helder Luis Baruffi, you are a shallow friend!","For twelve years up until several ago, I used to be friends with someone named **Helder Luis Baruffi**.  In case he's still active online by any chance, he goes by **such usernames as** Videokillah, Eczel Strata, Orsted, djdsm89995, unorthodox\_du, H-Man, Seijiro Mafun_©, etc.  Three years into our friendship, I thought up the premise of a rather sexual Pokemon story that I eventually titled Unwilling Service, that he expressed some great enthusiasm for at the time.  When I actually got started a few years later, he found my writing style bland, and offered to rewrite everything I'd write to flesh out not just the style, but the events, character development, and so on.  So, things went smoothly between us for the first chapter I did for Ellen's story.  Then came the first for the second one, about Johto's male lead Jamie.  He showed me his work early on, having given him muscles, and I asked that he remove them.  A second time he showed me, they were still there, and he explained having just gotten invested, but when he finished the chapter, he asked me to fix it myself, asked if he's actually supposed to buy his only transformation being an enlarged dick while the two girls get enlarged breasts and butts, and *then* fixed it.  Half of it anyway.  So, he asked to rewrite my stuff so that he could basically turn it into his own project?  I would have kicked him off the project had he not reverted anything, and the next two chapters, about May in Hoenn, went smoothly enough over the following year.  At some point, seeing how long I myself was taking with it, I abandoned the story for what would be a year and a half.  I only revived it in order to be doing *something* after a year-long failure to find anyone who would invest themselves in another project I knew Helder would hate, and even that failed.    Basically, he always had something going on to prevent him from continuing to beta-write, and so did I most of the time, which is part of the reason I allowed him to remain on board.  After a year of nothing, he finally threw in the towel, saying ""it didn't matter that"" he hated it and tried to forget all about it, only that he failed, citing ""half-measures"" as the real problem, and that all he could do at that point was apologize.    Contradicting that were more than a few signs of interest that he displayed up until then, another reason I trusted him that whole time.  Copying from an entry I would posted on DreamWidth when our friendship itself eventually ended (March 15, 2018, username: dmxrated):  *He wanted Mewtwo to Mega Evolve a certain way (can't remember between his X or Y forms), he wanted Dawn to try being a nudist like the protagonists and to participate in the Pal Park, he wanted Jamie to be naked upon meeting each of the Pokemon Idols, and even when he admitted his lack of interest in gym quests, he still went on to suggest ways to make it more interesting, asked to see my first entry about the story, requested a trial run of the Pal Park, and asked that each of the mains have a rival to compete against for that event. All of that, on top of requesting that I go through my blog to tag each entry where I talked about Pokemon, mentioning someone who found the premise amusing, sharing certain things with me like that tabletop game and something about parallel universes, and before I previously abandoned it, asking me to find it within me to care about it again. He even said yes when I asked if he'd ever be interested in a hypothetical visual adaptation of some sort.*  While there were a few red flags I should've picked up on, I figured he might've just needed a break from it.  Back to where I left off, he *had* started out remorseful enough, but when I asked him to explain himself, he began to, but then copped out and tried to leave it at ""halfway measures"", becoming increasingly annoyed when I pressed him to explain himself further.  Soon enough, he said ""Since you're not getting this, no Pokemon/human FUN!  I can't do anything that makes this fun.""  He did name a few things then, and I thought I could allow him to do certain things that I previously denied him permission.    I thought that would get us somewhere, and then that maybe he needed a break from the topic, but then, due to trouble I was having finding anyone on Upwork to replace him, I just broke down and told him on my blog to go fuck himself.  He called me out on offering him said break only to take it right back, and concluded what he said then with ""Hope you live happy without me.""  I apologized to him both by email and on my blog, but he rejected it, calling me out for blaming everyone, and especially the one I was apologizing to, for all my problems in life.  A month later, he did answer a question I had about someone's role he assigned in the story itself, and I thought we were on better terms then.  After a few more exchanges, though, he said that he still didn't consider me a friend anymore after what I said.  I tried to work something out with him, but he found some fault or another with almost everything I said to him or on my blog, until he asked what I intend to do to change my own ways, to which I managed to propose a few things.  He said then that he'd need time to think it over, but then I suggested that we resume our discussion at least months from then while I try to gather my thoughts.    In practice, I broke down a month later, said something to him, and while repentant again, going as far as to say ""I'm not gonna say that I'm 'better off' without you,"" and ""you're hurting yourself, and I can tell it's my fault,"" he told me that I need to forget about him once and for all.  Just a few weeks later, after posting what happened on TV Tropes: Troubled Production, I found another entry in the same place wicking to another trope, We Used to Be Friends.  Went on to read the real-life folder, where half the entries there mentioned the people in question reconciling later down the road.  That led me to consider the possibility that maybe we could as well at some point, especially since I myself once reconciled with another friend I had fallen out with earlier.  For a while, *that* was the main reason I didn't go on to post this entry back then.  I didn't want to *kill* any possibility that we could be friends again, until it became more than abundantly clear that it's just never gonna happen.  I tried emailing him again months later, and after not hearing back, wondered if maybe I did have stuff to apologize for.  A year later, I began to question that, reflected on my own respect for his and another friend's boundaries, and then brought it up with said other friend, who some time earlier suggested to be called Chelle.  She went on to explain that I was in fact a subpar friend overall to her, having done things that made her afraid to say no to stuff I wanted or even sever ties with me, and how people are not wired to take social risks easily.  Sure enough, I made efforts to redeem myself for her, and figured that he might've been willing to do the same one day once I convey how I improved myself.  To deny him such a chance as Chelle gave me would've seemed hypocritical at the time.  That became my next reason to give Helder the benefit of the doubt.  However, at some point, I couldn't help but wonder why, of all things I might have done, demanding proper accountability was what had led him to question his friendship with me.  What was that supposed to tell me about *him*?  I eventually brought things up again with Chelle, and whereas earlier she agreed with him on some points, such as my own disregard for others' feelings in favor of my own benefits, this time, she acknowledged that he might have had more agency than she did, assuming he didn't grow up indoctrinated to be a yes-man, and that he might've been toxic in his own right.  All remaining reasons for ever wanting to be friends again, or otherwise to hold back on posting this, gradually crumbled from there.  As little as we already had left in common when we fell out, there were certain things I still wanted from him.  But, they're actually pretty trivial, I have too much of a current agenda to want him back now, the things I *would* have to apologize for are things he could've shut down in the first place, and while I might be ready to embrace his interests more actively some time when I have most of my own stuff done, it's usally more practical just to find others who already share stuff in common with you.    But more importantly, he was actually abusive from the very beginning, and I should not have given him a second chance after he became particularly temperamental just two years into our friendship, when I took a month away from him.  At that time, I figured as long as he be friendly with me, I'd be okay, but in practice, his antics still crept up on me, and it usually seemed justified, though looking back, that probably shouldn't have mattered.  If anything, I should have told him off for real when we were talking about Zelda and he said ""I'll bet Majora's Mask was a spy game.""  One is allowed to make mistakes, and if every wrong thing you say is a reason for someone to get annoyed, maybe they're just looking for a reason just to elevate themselves or something.  What I wanted near the end wasn't just about more writing.  It was about actual empathy.  If he was a lot more cooperative and we still failed to reach a new agreement, that would've been fine.  Thing is, I did everything I could to appease him whenever I *really* pissed him off before, but with the roles reversed, even when we weren't talking directly about the story, he snapped back and said ""You said that already!"" when I tried to point something out that I mentioned on my blog, told me I'm the only one he's accepting critique from when I asked him to draw something up to make up for his failure w/ the story, and outright said wanting to let bygones be bygones when rejecting my soon-to-come apology.  Clearly, he wasn't really sorry to begin with.  Looking back now, I can see that everything he said was a phony excuse to justify a minimal effort to make anything right.  What little he did to atone means nothing since, obviously, he only cares about feeling better about himself instead of how the other person feels.  I'll never understand why first he decides for so long that his own feelings don't matter, and then *that's* what he prioritizes.  His name is something he asked me never to reveal to anyone even after he dies, when we arranged for me to mail stuff to him in lieu of Paypal.  And I'm doing just that to signify the end of what little respect I had still kept for him.  I'm not the one who ruined what we had.  You are.  I can't believe you were such a major part of my life for so long.    If something happens to you, consider it your own fault.  (That said, the story itself has long ceased to matter anymore.  However, unlikely as this will happen, if by some chance he actually grows up and acknowledges how wrong his and only his attitude was from beginning to end, if he feels nothing but remorse for anything, if he decides he wants to better himself, I might give him a chance to prove how sorry he really is, on my terms and mine alone.  Like I said, I'm not actually hoping anymore that we reconcile one day, but I would feel at least nice enough to let him resolve his own feelings if, unlike Bojack Horseman, he's willing to *earn* my forgiveness.)"
emotional,Is this abuse or am I overreacting?,"From a young age, my older sister has been terrible to me. When I was in elementary school, I would have to lock my doors while my sister had a __antrum_ in the other room, which usually meant she would get violent and would start yelling. This may seem vague, but one of my less vague stories happened when she tried to lock me on one of the rooms and pinned me down, and my parents couldn__ hear me in the other room. I couldn__ leave, and I was stuck underneath someone who I had been terrified of for years, and she wasn__ exactly weak. By the time I got out, I was a sobbing mess, asking my parents why they didn__ help. Some more recent stories are when she asks to play a game with me (I usually try to say no but she ends up saying that I__ a __elfish and terrible human being_ and coming into my room and yelling if i don__) and when I play,  she gets mad over every little mistake, and we usually end the night with her coming in and yelling at me and telling me I__ so selfish and such a hypocrite, and that I need to stop being such a baby, that im a terrible person. Maybe this wouldn__ be so bad if I wasn__ extremely scared of people yelling and have the tendency to start crying weather it__ me or someone else being yelled at. I have no safe space as I get yelled at by my parents if I lock my doors, and because we moved I can__ go over to peoples houses, even then she has no friends so she tries to take mine. She only has no friends because she does this to everyone one she is comfortable with them, but my friends seem to be alright with her hanging around all the time. To add to all of this, she doesn__ respect my pronouns (I use they/them) and my parents won__ do anything to stop her and get mad if I try to do anything. How bad is this? Is it even that bad?"
emotional,He's trying to turn it on me (23f),"Has anyone experienced their abuser try turn it back on you? My partner has just started crying saying I'm an evil person and I have a screw loose, all because I brought up the fact that he's told me over and over that he tries to put me down because I'm too confident and need to stay in my lane because I'm not good looking enough. I was speaking completely calmly and trying to explain that I would never try to make anyone feel that way especially my partner, and he became more and more irate arguing back with me then started crying and saying that I was evil. And I feel completely dumbfounded and exhausted because I've spent 3 years taking his abuse, for him to turn round and say that. And most likely tell people in his life that. It feels so frustrating I can't even put it into words."
physical,Anyone have experience with reporting your abuser for child abuse?,"Has anyone gone child abuse case?   My ex husband (who I believe is sociopathic) physically abused me when our son was 6 months old. He strangled me and I called the cops. I then got a 2 year order of protection, which granted him supervised visitation. I divorced him and was given full custody since I had a ton of evidence, and then they gave him unsupervised visitation for half the time. By then the OP was about the expire and there were no incidents in that 2 year period, which is why he was granted that. And they also said it was because he abused me, and not him. So they thought it was in our sons best interest to have a relationship with his dad.   Also, the states attorneys office charged him with 2 felonies: Aggravated Domestic Battery/Strangulation and Unlawful Restraint, and 2 misdemeanor domestic battery charges. He was given probation for 2.5 years. The States Attorneys office told me that for the first offense he wouldn't get jail time. But if there is another domestic violence related offense that he would get jail time next time. I'm in Illinois.   So everything was peaceful for a while. But about a week and a half ago my son came home with a huge bruise in the shape of a hand on his butt. He will be 4 next month. My ex admitted it to me and said that it was because he was throwing rocks at people. And that it made him realize that he has a problem and that he made an appt to go get on meds. He sounded genuine for a second. I thought about reporting it, but I was also worried that if I did he would retaliate against us. I also brought up what he did to me, and he said that I also played a part in it. So he failed to take any kind of accountability for strangling me.   When I hung up with him I asked my son what happened, and he said that it was bc he had a diarrhea accident in his pants _. And then he had another diarrhea accident later on and he spanked him a second time. He came back in a pullup, but he usually wears underwear. I told him lets put on some underwear, and he said ""No!! I cant put on underwear!! I can't have another accident, I cant!!"" He was so traumatized for several days that he was going to have an accident. I kept having to reassure him by saying that its okay to have accidents and that it's not his fault. And that if he has an accident that i'd just clean him up and give him a big hug and a kiss. And his expression finally changed from fear to relief. It broke my freaking heart! __  I decided to go to the cops and they took my statement and some pics. A few hours later a CPS worker came over and took pics and interviewed me and my son. My son told the CPS lady what happened. Both the cops and the CPS lady said that it was definitely abuse. I also went to the court house and was granted an emergency order of protection. So his visitation is currently reserved until we go back to court in 2 weeks for the 2 year OP. Im not sure if he was served yet though. I'm not allowed to contact him. And also, the other day they had me take him into the child advocacy center and they interviewed him. They had the police department's investigator, the CPS lady, and someone from the states attorneys office all listening in.   What can I expect to happen from here? Can anyone who has been through this share their experiences? They haven't charged him with anything yet. He is still on probation from what happened with me too btw."

emotional,Was I an abuser at the end of my relationship? I find it so hard to live with myself every day.,"He had just left a toxic relationship when we started dating (I had no idea about this relationship), however, due to these wounds, he would put my self-esteem down. He would call me an inept and other insults, he would criticize me for what I wore, he would compare me to his ex (she was prettier, smarter, bolder), he would criticize things I liked. I started to admit my fears of him and he started to change considering me admitting my fears. He truly has been nothing but extremely kind and nice! I swear, he was doing everything to make this work, while I was going through a bad period.   There__ two incidents before the breakup that really trigger me because I__ never been like before. I really hate that waking up in my body everyday considering these two incidents. On Monday, we were playing this online game and he got a bit frustrated with me for something and I took it very personally (because in the past that may have lead him to getting angry with me, although his reactions had changed). I started crying and it affected me too easily and he said he __elt guilty_. I know that when suffering emotional abuse we may feel guilty or feel like we__e walking on eggshells due to our partner__ reaction. I never meant to make him feel this way. I threw up that night out of fear for how I reacted. The next day because of this I was still filled with discomfort that I called him too many times full of anxiety and I was simply crying and scared. I wasn__ saying anything hurtful (except for one thing that remains imprinted on me), he told me that I__ going to act like this in every relationship which really hurt me and I stupidly said that my ex texted me (I__ never even been in serious relationship, I was waiting to lose my virginity with this current boyfriend). He wasn__ really an __x_, he was just a friend. It was awful what I said and I__ very regretful and feel a lot of shame. It wasn__ right I know. I made that comment because he made me feel unworthy as if I__l always be a terrible girlfriend. I really valued our relationship and would never even want that ex of mine.  I swear it was me who created this scenario that, ultimately, ended the relationship. Yes, he__ been abusive in the past but that does not excuse anything. He said he was feeling down when he broke up with me and that he__ never be happy. He said other hurtful things. It hurts to know his heart was down.   The same morning we broke up he thanked me for my __xtreme kindness_ but I don__ know if that was just to be nice to me.   I cry every single day wondering if I was abusive. I__ going to talk to my therapist about this too. I must overcome this.   I know how it feels to be hurt emotionally, I__ never want to hurt anybody else. Especially unnecessarily when he was affirming __e could work through this together_ and I took advantage of his gentleness.y heart aches for him still. Was I abusive? Thank you!"
physical,My self-defense left a mark and now my boyfriend is sending photos to people,"He had me pinned down with his arm and all I could do was bite, then he took pictures of the bite mark and I think he sent them to family.

physical,I was the abusive partner - please give advice if possible,"Hello all,  So it's really difficult for me to say, but I'm now 26, and when I was 18 I was in a 2 and a half year relationship. I was heavy into watching MMA, as well as general sports, gaming and general stuff.  For the intent and purpose of this message, I'm not going to comment on anything she did wrong to me, simply because there is no excuse for domestic violence.  Myself and my partner I always imagined as a happy couple, however looking back I realise that I was absolutely horrible, and some times I was very abusive (maybe not VERY in comparison to some, but compared to how I now see myself, I was very abusive). Although I never just ""hit"" her, if we were play fighting, I'd sometimes take it too far to the point that I'd hurt her and I knew I'd done it and I used to almost try and laugh it off. I remember one time she cried because I put her too heavy into a rear naked chokehold and she couldn't breathe and although I felt horrible afterwards, it's taken years for me to fully comprehend what I was doing.  In the two and a half years, we never had sex, although she'd always explicitly said she didn't want to, I'd always try and creep closer and closer to doing it. Sometimes I'd get the tip slightly in but she didn't like it and I'd keep trying until I could clearly see it was too much. I know in hindsight what this is and I feel absolutely awful about it.   In addition, I was extremely emotionally abusive. I'd always get extremely jealous so I basically didn't want her speaking to any guys, I was constantly checking her phone, and I was simply always paranoid.   When I think back to the relationship, I think she only stayed with me because she was scared, and when she had the opportunity to go to university, she never spoke to me again and looking back, I'm so glad she made that decision.  But what I want to ask, is I know I've been abusive and I feel terrible. I've tried to apologise over the years but I realise that seeing a message from me probably terrifies her so I don't want to bother her. I know this will live with her for the rest of her life, and as such, I know I don't deserve any help whatsoever, however some nights I'll not sleep because of how awful I feel for the way I treated her, and for the things I did, and I want someone to speak to about it but I'm terrified to talk to somebody. I'm not terrified because I might get in trouble, because frankly I deserve it, I'm terrified because I've not found anywhere about people being about to get help if they've been the abuser and I don't know what to do. Sometimes I find myself with my current partner complaining about things she isn't doing (like she'll go a week without showering, or she won't wash up) and now anytime I tell her she needs to do something, I always start to feel like I'm abusing again even though I know my request is understandable.  If you want to abuse me in the comments for being abusive I understand, and if I could turn back time I would. No-one deserves what I did, however I'd like some help for myself to be able to overcome this and feel OK again. I know it may be too much to ask, but does anyone have any advice?"

emotional,DAE have relapses over unrelated stressors?,"Hello and sorry if this has been asked before.  Is it ""normal"" to have emotional flashbacks to the abuse even years later and that they are triggered by something completely unrelated to the actual abuse.  For example, I'm under a lot of stress and I keep having nightmares and emotional dysregulation. Is it common that there is no logic to triggers? Or that every setback triggers a traumatic relapse?"
physical,I have survived,"Hello Everyone!   I just found this group and as much as I__ love for this group to not exist, I am happy that there are people who are walking the same path as me. Thankfully, I have never met another person who has experienced domestic violence. I suspect it__ because I tend to avoid friendships due in part to my ptsd and my unwillingness to openly trust people.   It has taken me several years to view myself as a survivor. I struggles so much. Not only was I suffering from PTSD and not seeking treatment I was also so very bitter that I had to deal with such a difficult life.   Eventually I reached the point where I could no longer function, I realized that though I was alive I wasn__ actually living.   That__ the crazy part. Abusers often take an already broken person and break them into a thousand more pieces. I believed that somehow I was innately flawed unworthy of love. I hated me and because I did I didn__ bother getting to know who I was, what I liked and disliked. This feelings don__ just leave as soon as you end the relationship.   It takes such a long time to learn to love yourself and realize that the views that your abuser had of you need not be your views as well. But it__ so difficult isn__ it? What people don__ realize is that the abuse continues for some even though we__e long since left in this way.   I__ still very much learning who I am, but I am finding that I greatly enjoy learning what I like and how I want to present myself to the world.  I am hoping that I am able to communicate with people in this group as a way to help each other along our journeys and to connect with people who understand what it is to be in an abusive relationship."
physical,Domestic Violence Thread _§µ__,"Hello everyone,  I'd like to share my personal behavior against my girlfriend with whom I've been with for one year now. For the past 2 months we've been back and forth with several arguments, mainly because of my insecurities. I tend to leave our house every time we have a bad argument get my stuff and get back together a few days after the fact. To be specific I wouldn't be thinking anything negative about her behavior or grow any suspicioun if she wouldn't have behaved the way she does. It's mostly about her phone and how nervous she gets when she's close to me where I can some what see her screen. I know privacy for both parties is important but I think that when someone fears something or gets nervous about something. In this case her cellphone, then you are guilty about something. So I then grew very suspicious of her, of course. I sat down to talk to her and we tried to communicate together. One night I went for a drink which then turned into one too many, and I went home drunk. I off course was being an irresponsible civilian by driving under the influence. To knock it off, I hit a curve and my tire popped. So I called her to pick me up, and so then 10 minutes later we take off in her car. I left my car at a local convenient store. On our drive home I realized I was driving a bit over 60 mph on a 35 mph zone. Which was totally wrong of me. Then when we get home the arguing begins, most of which had to due with her phone. See at that time it was getting close to her birthday and I had bought her a new cellphone for her birthday to replace her old phone. But there was an issue with her giving me her old phone passcode for a technician to transfer her old data to her new phone. This totally triggered me but I was of course silent I never mentioned how much it bothered me the way she behaved about her phone. So of course the influence of alcohol gave me the courage to confront her, and so I did. Which them grew in alot of yelling and screaming. I threw her new phone to the wall and shattered it. I thought after that we would have calmed down. But i chocked her while we were laying down in bed for 3 to 7 seconds. That was the first incident.  So then we of course thought we settled it and God knows how passionate and stupid love can make us humans. Well the next incident had to do with her calling me by someone else's name at night while we were sleeping. I woke up to her calling me some other man's name, I of course was going to question that. So I did, I woke her up and asked her who that was, and she mentioned her brother. Which turned out to be true.  I got my things and left immediately, I didn't want to be in a house with someone that I thought was cheating on me. She then grew very nervous after getting my things I noticed she wasn't feeling so well about our argument. She got very sick that day she missed work, and I stayed to care for her. I know that this may be a little long, but please bare with me.  After that argument everything seemed well, my biggest problem is I leave and I come back.  3rd incident One night we were sleeping in bed and I noticed her using her phone under the covers. I woke up to that several times but I never confronted her about it. But one night I grew the courage to mention it to her , which turned out to be a medium argument compared to the others we had. Of course it was during Thanksgiving and I decided not to spend it with her. Because I felt betrayed, instead of communicating with her I decided to be selfish.  Turned out to be she talks in her sleep and also acts in her sleep.  4th argument   This was by far the worst of them all, I never felt the way I felt in any relationship, like she has made me feel. Like we've been going back and forth frequently for the past two months. But this argument was by far the worst because I slapped her.  I am well aware that nothing she did or I say justifies my behavior or actions, and poor decisions.  As usual I come home shower and go to bed around 9 PM and we usually chat for a bit have conversations about our day, and fall asleep. This night we were sleeping she started calling me her bosses name. I know his name because she has mentioned him to me before, and how good he looks.  I realized she was talking to him in her sleep, in a flirty way. And I begin to respond to her like if I was him, but this time I recorded her doing it. For evidence of course. Well that morning I didn't mention it to her but I told her that she did it again, and she asked me what she did. I told her I would tell her about it before Christmas.  She nagged to get it out of me, I of course didn't break.  A few days later, it happened again and this time I woke her up from her sleep.  And told her you know this isn't the first time you mention your boss in your sleep . That of course made me very suspicious, insecure, sadden, I almost hated the fact that she wouldn't admit that she was cheating on me.  And that night I decided to ask a Co worker her thoughts about the situation. So we agreed to meet at a local bar that evening and she shared her opinions to me based on my situation.  And I recorded her saying message "" A woman that hides her phone to her man is cheating. There is no loyalty where there is privacy."" And I of course go home drunk, I parked my car as if I knew what I was going home for. I immediately grab my things and begin to argue with her. And out of my frustration and stupidity I slapped my girlfriend in her face.  I of course said so many mean things to her because I wanted her to feel the pain I felt.   That night I slept in one of my rental properties, and I completely block her from every platform on social media, phone, and email.  But then this guilty conscious grew within me so huge, that it made me very depressed. And to this day I still am. We got back together the next day I confessed my pain and she mentioned that the only way to fix things is to fix myself,  and stay in the relationship.  I don't why she is staying with me after what I've done to her. I feel very confused. Please share your thoughts guys and gals. Thank you"

emotional,My Journey to overcoming a lifetime of depression and mental abuse. And you can too!,"Hello people,__ I would like to share my personal journey and help those who are struggling from depression and anxiety. I have a toxic parent who used to emotionally and verbally abuse me since my childhood, it's only when I got older the verbal got reduced as I would show rage against it. But the emotional abuse continued. Amongst all this, I felt having a troubled childhood, no friends in early years and pretty much a lot of mental health issues and no progress in life. Eventually during my Bachelor's there came a time of realization that I cannot cope with my emotions even if I emptied it in front of a college friend. Nothing helped. I wasn't able to sit for meditation. No focus on work or anything. That's when I decided to meet a psychiatrist. Often times due to prolonged exposure to immense stress our brain stops producing serotonin or produces very low of it which is necessary to function properly... So I took some SSRI's with a very strong intent that these are just temporary and I'll only take them until I start gaining a hold of myself. Eventually, I did but by that time an year had gone by and I was a peasent to these meds, if I missed them I felt horrible. But with my immense will I wanted to get off these drugs. My doc wasn't letting me vome off. So I met a different doc and asked him how can I stop taking these medicines as I actually have more control over myself. They gave me a plan of over two months to taper in a way that was actually possible. And here I am it's been more than 8 months now since I left drugs and overcame depression. Ps: I also visitied a lot of psychologists for those paid talk therapy sessions and they helped a bit but mostly just burned money. Pro tip: It is possible to overcome depression. But there's always a reason behind what caused it. And you should try getting rid of the reason. That would immensely help you for life. If it's behavioural then try fixing that. If you have to get on meds intially don't hesitate because the leaving them part is still hell. But at times without them you won't be able to start your journey to healing. But always have it in the back of your minds that even if you take pills then also you're going to work hard to improve your mental state. It would take time and commitment but it's extremely possible. Millions have done it and you will too! Thank you. I wish this could help someone."
physical,Father has just slapped my sister,"Hello Reddit this is my first post and I really need some advice on what to do.  Here__ a background: my sister and her boyfriend are 19, I__ 16. Our parents( by our I mean just me and my sisters) are really strict and verbally abusive, we make one mistake and they get really stubborn about it and gaslight us this has taken a toll on me and my sister and I suffer from severe depression and anxiety because of how they treat us.  So today, My sister__ boyfriend came over today and when he left, my mom noticed a hickey on my sister__ neck. She ended up telling our dad about it and he got really upset. My sister was really fed up so she locked herself in our room ( we share a room). I was confused why she had locked the door, then I hear my dad banging on the door telling her to unlock it, then he yells for me to unlock it. I__ sitting there confused and don__ know what I should do. My sister then goes __ou have to protect me_ and that sentence makes my heart drop to my stomach, our parents have never laid their hands on us and haven__ whooped/spanked us since we were younger so I didn__ know what to expect. Our dad ends up unlocking the door and dashes towards my sister telling her __hy do you have a hickey?_ __mon let__ talk_,  in a very furious and angry tone, he then grabs her by the arm and she frees herself and jumps on my bed. He follows her and then slaps her across the face. I stood there in shock for a second and yell at him to stop __hat__ enough!_ I laid on top of her for a second as a shield, and he shoved me off. He then goes on top of her and does a motion to slap her a second time, but doesn__. My sister yells for our mom, and when she walks in she told her our dad slapped her. All our mom did was say that when parents hit their kids that means they love them and that she shouldn__ be so upset. My sister starts sobbing and our dad scolds her and tells her to stop crying. My sister tells our mom she__ gonna move out and she__ gonna call her boyfriend, and our mom just says don__ you dare tell anyone about this. In the end my sister decides not to call her boyfriend because our dad has a lot of knives and he would be the type to fight her boyfriend too. So here we are now sitting in our room just me and my sister in shock of what just happened and don__ have a clue what to do next.  TL;DR : dad finds out sister has a hickey and slaps her"
physical,I don__ know what to think about this. (24M/29F- LDR),"Hello! I__ psychologist but because this is something happening to me  that I can__ just figure it out alone and rationally. I know it kinda has sense but it hurts.  My partner met his ex last week. She is abusive with him (psychologically) and usually harm herself. Always controlling him. Also blame him because her suicide thoughts and threat him. So, he helped her to pick up her things from home. And while outside she told him want to be hitting by a car. My partner is always afraid and blame himself if something happen so, he told me he KISSED HER to calm her down. Later she posted that he even made him a kiss mark...   He told me he is weak when think about her suicide thoughts, he didn__ do it for her. And it is very afraid of her.  We wasn__ exclusive by that time... We are now. At that time we just used to talk everyday and I already knew about his feelings for me.  This episode can__ get out of my mind. It is very painful... and I don__ know if I should not worry about it.  What do you think about it? He says he loves me and didn__ do it for love but fear..."
emotional,Feeling bad about anxiety,"Hello,  I got out of my emotionally abusive relationship about a year ago. I finally was able to get my name off of her car loan and title just this month, and we had no kids or anything else shared, so I think I am finally free of her!  She lied all the time in our relationship and gaslit me like crazy. When I would confront her, she would get angry and break things.  Anyways, to get all this car business straightened out, I had my attorney dealing with her. He forwarded me some messages she sent him and it made me have severe anxiety.   She was doing weird gaslighting double talk to him in emails and basically just making me look like garbage and her like a saint.  Just reading it made my heart race and I felt bad for days. It was like a relapse or something. I felt hopeless and upset and incredibly hurt.   I thought about it and realized that the way she talks does not affect me anymore at all. I'm paying my attorney, not her, and the deal is already through so I never need to see an email from her again. Realizing this made me feel worse though because it feels like my severe anxiety was invalid. It's just words on a screen so why am I so scared of this?  Anyone experience this sort of feedback loop before?  I just wish I could actually see that it's over and not feel terrible just reading that text."
physical,Support dealing with false accusations of domestic violence,"Hello,  My spouse is pregnant and recently falsely accused me of domestic violence. She called the police, who believed her lies, and I got arrested. She has refused to lift the no contact and is moving forward with the charges. There is no evidence, because I did not do anything. It__ literally her word against mine and the police sided with her, I believe because she__ a woman and pregnant.   Yes, our relationship was struggling but I have never abused anyone, ever. She had been mentally, emotionally and physically abusing me for years (telling me I__ constantly wrong, forgetful, attacking my tastes, who I am, slapping me, throwing water on me). When I put my foot down, she called the police. Based on my research, this is typical behavior of a narcissistic abuser. Once they lose control, they destroy the situation or escalate the situation so they can maintain control.   As I opened up about my story to friends and family, I began to learn that false accusations of DV is more common than I thought.  But I am not able to find support groups for people dealing with false accusations of DV. I need help. Who has gone through this situation before? How did your situation pan out? Any advice?"
physical,Cannot Afford a divorce,"Hello, I am a seventeen year old living in a house with two parents, a sister, and a dog., United States  My father has been emotionally abusing my mother for a while now, with offs and ons, but it always resorts back to him emotionally abusing my mother. I do not wish to go into much detail, but everyone in my family (mother, myself, sister) have politely told our father how he constantly emotionally abuses my mother. At this point, it is impossible to speak to him, as no matter what you will say, no matter how polite, any constructive criticism you give him will result in him blaming you for ""attacking"" him. He will constantly start screaming at my mother when she is asking questions that a normal wife would ask her husband, like ""Hey I saw you went out for a bit, where did you go?"" in the politest, kindest manner possible. No matter what she does, says, anything, he screams at her constantly.  My family is in the lower middle class. We live in an apartment that is by far the cheapest in my area, and we cannot afford to separate. My mother works tirelessly at her job throughout the day, only to have to clean the house, clean up my father's messes, deal with his emotional abuse, care for her children. There are little opportunities for different places that we can move into. My sister is in college, and it is already hard enough to pay for that, let alone move out and go through all of the costs to do that. Since school is currently online due to COVID-19, internet is a necessity and that threatens to go away based on its cost.   My father cannot be trusted with money. As a child, I would obtain birthday and Christmas money, and I would often save it up for years at a time, just for my father to ""borrow"" hundreds of dollars and never pay it back. He is an untrustworthy, lying, quick-to-anger, self-centered, emotionally abusing man.  Another problem is our dog. We were lucky enough to make an agreement with our landlords to even have a dog in the first place, and it will be hard to find a place that will allow dogs. We would also need to be able to afford to move our stuff.  We will also be paying for my college after next year.  We do not know what to do."
emotional,Am I being Emotionally Abused?,"Hello, I am a young teen and I have been discovering changes over the past year in my interactions with people in my life.  I have been pondering about my relationship with my parents for a few days now because they have been adding more timid towards me and my brother recently. The only reason I have been questioning if they are emotionally abusing me because they tend to all my wants and needs, actively remind me how amazing of parents they are and how much they care for me.   The only downside to this is that whenever I try to critique something they do (which is rare) they remind me of how spoiled and ungrateful I am, which has made me worry and feel guilty whenever I ask to buy something to the point of me not asking for items for months.  Firstly, I don't really feel happiness nor sorrow in a normal situation. I barely feel regular happiness. I feel guilty talking about my emotions, as I think someone always has it worse than I do.   My mother has recently picked up on this and shames me for it, but covers it up as assistance. I can barely engage conversation with her because of it. Because of this, we argue often and she plays the victim. She gives me the silent treatment, shames me, and sometimes (rarely) goes out of her way to attempt to physically harm me, and portrays it as an accident. She will actively disrespect me or not speak to me at all until I apologize.  Secondly, I always feel guilty saying ""no"" to my parents. Even if it__ as simple as saying I dislike something. I feel like I would be letting them down or even hurt their feelings.   Sometimes whenever I say no or try as respectfully to defend myself, they will yell at me and say that I backtalk, often comparing me harshly to others.  Lastly, I feel like I have no privacy. My mother actively reminds me that she believes I will have to learn the cruel reality of adulthood on my own  so she will not supervise my internet access. She also tells me she will never give away my secrets, but I have caught her gossiping about my most shameful moment with her friends, even though she promised she would never tell a soul.  One day, she looked through some of my messages on Discord between a few of my real life friends whenever I was going through a really troublesome phase and started yelling and threading me and I started having a breakdown. After a few hours we resolved the conflict and she promised to never tell anyone. Months later, I saw her venting with one of her coworker about it over text and it destroyed my trust in her. If I were to confront her about it would make everything worse.  That is only afew things they have done to me over the past year. Am I being emotionally abused or is this normal?"
physical,Moving out from abusive boyfriend,"Hello, I am new here. My friend began the relationship with her boyfriend one year and a half ago. The relationship become very toxic as the guy want everything his way. He once kick my friend out of her own apartment and left her in the freezing winter night for two hours just because she is _ not being supportive on his study_ And he frequently lose control, or just act like he is losing control. He would yell at my friend and smash the table over small things like whether to drink water on dinner table. He also lose control when my friend don__ take his suggestions. The guy never really hit her though. My question is, how should my friend break up and leave the place? She has some boxes of stuff and a cat.  She does not have a car. Just telling him she want to leave would not be an option since it__ dangerous if he lose control. Me and my friend will be grateful for any advice! Thank you!"
emotional,Currently abandoned by my avoidant ex on my first trip to Europe,"Hello, I am really grateful this group exists. I am in a really bad situation and don't have any support.  My on again off again partner was the only person I knew in the new town we moved to in Canada, during all of lockdowns. I have autism and other disabilities and became high support during that time.  He has an avoidant attachment style and despite being a good communicator and both of us having healthy lifestyles, the relationship became rife with emotional abuse.  One of my ways of getting ahead in life was to tour Europe for my first time and return to my job as an art model. In the month before departure, he hoovered me back and decided to go with me. He is Dutch and has family in Netherlands, so his mother bought us tickets which was a big deal.  On the first week here my PMDD hit and I was unmedicated, and he was unable to offer any support. He was feeling all the pressures from family and after isolating me from them in a trailer while he stayed inside, he finally kicked me out and ended the 3 year relationship.  I am now alone without knowing the language, with huge disability flare ups. I was willing to take accountability for my side of the issues, because I have no issue with that in terms of shame etc. But he is unable to see his role or responsibility in any of it, and I can not bare with the fact that he basically left me out here for dead, because I am al vulnerable.  Help - I have no one to talk to, and need to start work. I subletted out my home back in Canada, and have nowhere to go back to.  What can I do to process his actions?  Thanks in advance"
emotional,Is my dad abusive?,"Hello, im 13 and my parents divorced 2 years ago. The reason for their divorce were the alcohol problems that my dad experiences.

Me and my boyfriend were having an argument about his dog because she is constantly causing issues in our home. (I'm not going to go into detail, I have a separate post in a different sub about it)  For the last few months any time I talk about how I'm feeling about something in a negative way my boyfriend will tell me to ""stop whining"" and if I cry then he gets even worse with the ""why are you so fucking whiney"" etc.   Today he said ""if you don't stop being so fucking whiney then I'll start hitting you"".   I'm scared and confused. I don't mean to make him angry?  I told him that what he said was horrible and he apologised but then he said it was because I'm ""acting like a victim"".  What should I do? Am I overreacting? I keep thinking  maybe I am just too whiney but I'd never threaten to hit someone for that?"
emotional,Thinking back is being made to think I was clinically insane unintentionally abusive?,"Hello, so Ive been doing some reflecting for the last while about ny childhood. I thought it was pretty normal but people have told me not so much on certain points. Ill say Im not the best about opening up to people and am a very private person about even my hobbies, so I dont always share things that happened when I was younger but a friend said it was kind of messed up about the following story.  I have an aunt specifically that is diagnosed with schizophrenia, she was my dads sister and she would refuse to take her medication. She would never get violent but would call the house incessantly and would bother my dad sometimes every day.   Being a small child I would go to bother him cause I wanted to play around. He would get upset and yell ""shut up schizo aunts name"". He wouldn't do this all the time growing up but never really said anything on it and would do so if I ever tried to bother him after talking to my aunt.   I dont think it was nessaritly intentional, my family wasnt always great growing up in other ways, but this made me fear that I would develop Schizophrenia. As well as  just sort of put me off from mental health service.   Is this considered emotional abuse even if he didnt nessaritly mean it?   Tldr Was called by a schizophrenic aunts name by dad when mad. Is that considered emotional abuse?"
emotional,"Awful repressed memory, should I change therapist or just talk to someone else?","Hello. I'm going to share something nparent did that has to do with knifes and suicide. If that triggers you, please stop reading immediately. Otherwise bear with me.   When I was 4 years old, I distinctively remember a huge fight between grandma and mom breaking out. One of them had a knife, it was probably mom. I remember that it happened on the staircase and then the word ""dishes"" but I don't remember anything else.  I don't know who got stabbed, but my mom told me that she had to take me off kindergarten because I would chase other kids holding a pencil like a knife and I would stab my desk. I don't really care about this memory. It kinda feels like I wasn't there, but I'm scared.  Because of some other fuckery momma did, (she attempted suicide to take money for my grandma), and because when I hit a kid without reason whatsoever, she treated it like the most normal thing in the world and she just told me ""Well I guess you're not going to school tomorrow!"" I had recently extreme pain in my chest to the point where I couldn't breathe and I could remember distinctively the time I hit another kid on its head. I also remembered the screams of my grandma pleading for my mother to stop and not jump and just think about me. Thank God I only had two episodes last week and as long as I'm not actively thinking about the event, it's all good. I'm abridging a bit just to move on to my question.  I go to therapy like every week but thing is I don't think I'm getting any help. My therapist is basically focusing on just moving forward, which is okay and I can get that but does that guarantee that I'm gonna be okay? Also, I'm having a lot of memory problems but he just doesn't acknowledge that. He thinks I'm trying to push the blame to my memories or to a condition in case moving out fails. (Yeah I'm moving out from nparent and it's a long process but I don't doubt it's gonna workout)  Should I talk to someone else, or is there a better way to tell him about this? Should I seek help from a psychotherapist?  I feel lost."

I travelled across the country to see my family and last night I witnessed a physical/verbal altercation between my parents for the first time ever. Never saw that as a kid.  Everyone is safe now.

Iï¸ went into an anxiety attack and began to beg and plead, pushing on the door. He was basically saying that he was disappointed in me and that Iï¸ was acting crazy. He wasn__ wrong. Eventually after 30 mins of crying and scratching the door Iï¸ shouldered it. The door busted open, and now the frame is damaged. We were both shocked and Iï¸ felt horrible. He was obviously angry, but has forgiven me as of this morning without a lot of anger or resentment.   I__ horribly ashamed. Iï¸ grew up with both parents being physically and mentally abusive. My last ex beat me multiple times and even strangled me, leading me to leave him. Iï¸ never wanted to become them. Iï¸ am in therapy, and every time Iï¸ seem to take a bunch of steps forward Iï¸ seem to take some back. It__ so disappointing as our last few disagreements we were able to handle better, but alcohol exacerbated this one. Iï¸ don__ want to give up on this. Iï¸ want to marry this man. His ex was physically and mentally abusive as well. He__ also picked at the door before, breaking a piece of it when we__e gotten mad and I__e locked the door. But not broken it like Iï¸ did last night.   Iï¸ feel like a monster. Iï¸ feel like I don__ even want to tell my therapist this, although Iï¸ know Iï¸ need to. We__e contacted multiple couples therapists but it__ taking forever to get the ball rolling with covid. I__l get some replies, then nothing.   Iï¸ guess Iï¸ just would love some advice from anyone or specifically people who have overcome these tendencies or issues in their own relationships. Feeling pretty hopeless and disappointed in myself now. Iï¸ keep looking at the door frame and braking down in tears."
physical,How to heal my eye,"Hey friends, I'm back. He was driving me home from my dad's last night and I don't remember how it got so heated because I was drunk but he ""accidentally"" smacked me really hard on the nose, so hard I was speechless and immediately started tearing up. I pushed his hand away when he reached out for me and he punched my eye, and so I turned away from him and he started beating my back.  My back is okay but my eye and the bridge of my nose are hurting. I can't open my eye all the way. The bruise hasn't developed much yet but my eyelid is starting to turn purple/red. I think he knocked out my contact when he hit me and if he didn't it's stuck in there somewhere but I can't see well regardless. The light makes it hurt a lot worse.  I figured this subreddit probably has a lot of practice in healing eye injuries so if you have tips on what I can do let me know. He was offering to take me to the doctor last night but I was sobbing and afraid to get in the car again. Maybe I should go to a doctor, I don't know. I need to pack my things and figure out who I can talk to or stay with. He said he'll get his shit out and find an apartment somewhere else.  Just a few hours before we were putting up our Christmas tree. This isn't the first time he's done it but I thought we were doing better since he started therapy. I'm only 20. It's already so much to live alone and support myself while I'm in school. I don't know how to handle these things or talk to anyone. I know I deserve kindness, it's just hard to believe I'll fucking find it.  Let me know if I need to go to a doctor or how I can expedite the healing. I've just been putting ice around the area so far."
physical,I forgot most of my childhood after witnessing domestic violence,"Hey guys!  So to get to the point, my dad was and still is an alcoholic. He used to beat my mom regularly.. It was a nightmare. Due to being a poor family, we were all living in the same room and I had to witness daily fighting and occasional beatings, and also to witness my mom being locked outside of the house in the winter not even wearing shoes and being terrified to do or say anything. I would be scared to go to school because I might find her dead.  He was truly evil and taught me to not tell anyone what is happening in that house. I kept it a secret until I was 16 and could finally trust a person. Even if I had neighbours who knew about it, I never told a word. That lifestyle put a very harsh mark on me. I was shy, I got bullied, very low self esteem. Those things got better over time, but what never stopped is the emotional numbness and the fact that I can't remember half of my life.. I'm sure there were good moments from the kindergarten or with my friends playing. But sadly I don't remember much..  I hope no child goes through that or at least gets help on time.. for people like me, I don't think there is much to do anymore."
physical,"I need out, struggling with exit planning. My story and many details. What do you guys think?","Hey guys, I'm a 24 year old woman who's been in a relationship for 6 years with an on/off abusive 25 year old male.  For all these years i struggled with assertiveness because i came from an abusive family. I grew up in a toxic house hold and obviously wasn't shown what real love should look like. I always wanted to learn from that and be a better person than my parents were.  My parter and I hardly fight but even when we do, he yells and gets aggressive physically and emotionally. I usually get bad anxiety and just want it to stop so i just get quiet and let him just let it out. He was more verbally abusive and emotionally abusive, but every now and then he would throw things at me, grab me by my neck, push me, raise a hand at me. And he usually instigates and brings it on first. If not and i actually just try to talk to him like a human being (calm and logical), and he doesn't like what he hears (truth) he will make it seem like I'm the bad guy and he will get aggressive behavior and gaslight me and manipulate me. He basically will usually throw a tantrum like a little kid especially over the little things. It's weird too because theres few times he will actually talk to me about a conflicting matter and he is really good with his words and helps me understand better, i just wish he was like that more.  He also has cheated on me in a non physical way, but he told me he planned on it before. He would message other females, creep on them, find all their accounts to see what they have to look at, he would go looking on escort sites and fetlife, onlyfans, and subscribe to them and pay them money to see their photos and videos and offer tips for extra. Meanwhile he doesn't spend a dime on me, not that i want someone to spend money on me (that's not the point), we hardly have money to be spending as it is, i always remained loyal to him.  He made me constantly feel like i was never enough. I would doll myself up to look good for him, give him what ever he wanted when ever he wanted (sexually) (sorry if tmi), i always come home from working all day to cook for him and clean up the house after him. I was trying to be that perfect house wife.  I lost myself. I don't recognize myself. I am mentally unwell. But i still take care of myself and keep up with work and the house everyday. I do my best to look after my mental health because i had a couple close calls.  The older i get the more i realize that he isn't going to change. Yes he doesn't message girls like he used to anymore but he's still going behind my back crossing boundaries over the things mentioned above (yes i talked to him countless times). I am learning to stand up for myself and when i try, that's when he puts hands on me.  I want out. I love him but I'm not in love. I am starting to realize that i need out. That i have no more energy to waste on him, waiting for him to act right. Life is too short.  We cant just break up. He is predictably unpredictable. If i told him i wanted to split, for all i know he could throw all my things outside and damage my belongings. Or he would beg me to stay and cry and promise me he will change, to threatening his own life.  I cant afford to leave. I work full time. I only have a drivers permit, going for my license this fall, i wont have a car until at least next year if I'm lucky. Social assistance takes time and i would lose everything i have worked for and be homeless, lose my job my belongings ect.. And the thing that sucks the most is that i have zero friends or family to stay with. I have no support. And im far from shelters so i can't go there.  If i stay, i benefit the most, financially and I'm more ""secure"" for the time being. I am working on getting caught up (license/car, looking for new job, paying off credit card debt). I would love to go to school and take something so i can get a better career and support myself and i can get a scholarship through my current job which is nice. But i need to focus on getting a car and paying off my credit card.  Once i get get a car and get a career from post secondary, i will be able to support myself. But im looking at 2 years. I just worry what to do if i have to make a quick escape."
physical,My friend is being abused,"Hey, I__ asking for a friend 20(F). UK  Just for context she is currently going to university but her parents are forcing her to do a degree which she doesn__ want to do. Both of her parents are alcoholics but her dad is abusing her mum. Both of them are violent towards her.   She took evidence of their abuse, and recorded it. She has a sibling however he dislikes her and she has no contact with him. She had been expressing how she no longer wants to live as she has been dealing with this from a young age. Out of fear she keeps quiet as that__ how her parents have raised her, otherwise things will get physically violent.  She has not told her university fully regarding her situation at home... She can__ work and go to university with this abuse as it__ having a toll on her mental health.   She doesn__ feel safe at home and really would like to get away from all of this.  Any UK advice would be great.  I hope someone can help Thank you"
physical,I need advice on what to do. Please.,"Hey, I've never taken to an online forum before so please, just bear with me. I'm 16 btw with siblings 8 and 10 years old, my parents are in their late forties.  My mom and dad have been together for over twenty years. Every one of those twenty years, my mom has paid the price for seeing good in a damaged person.  My dad came from a broken family and a background of poverty. His dad died when he was a kid, and his mom remarried. Her husband left them after a few years and my dad had to support his mom and two stepbrothers by himself. Left home when he was 15 to work for them. Even after he came to Australia, he'd been sending money home, usually in thousands. This resulted in many arguments, yelling matches and physical abuse. My mom had been tolerating this because she had nowhere to go, no family in the country we live in. This happened up until last year when he promised to never lay a hand on her, and his mom died, so we thought it was over.   It wasn't. I became the victim of his physical abuse, and mum was now being tortured emotionally. She defended me against him, and he kicked her out of her bedroom and she now has to sleep on a double bed with my other two siblings. Just last week, we went to get help, but mom doesn't want to separate. Mom's holding out, hoping we could get him to change. She reckons he's not a bad person, just doesn't have any control. She's waiting for an apology and an invite back to her own bedroom. It's been four weeks. I think dad wants an apology for her defending me.  I don't know how much more of this I can take. My sisters are innocent and their childhood is being ripped out from under their feet while I can only watch. My mom blames us three for her predicament.  She takes her bitterness out on us. She doesn't know the pain she's causing them from her statements and I'm completely torn. I already have anxiety from my own childhood and I don't want it to happen to them. I'm a good student and I can't concentrate on my schoolwork, and the worst part is that I don't think she's gonna give up on dad. I want out but I can't because mom will expect me to stay, whether she separates with dad or not. It hurts me to see my siblings like this and every time I try to defend or protect them, she ignores me. My family life is destroying me. Seeing my mom and siblings like this is destroying me. I want out.   Sorry about how lengthy this is, I kinda went on a tangent here. I need advice on what to do. This whole thing is really complicated and it's driving me around the bend. Please."

physical,Disabling Phone Tracker Options?,"Hi - I have the opportunity to try to apply for a new job, but it is important that I find out a way to disable whatever location/call/auditing tracker apps that might have been installed on my phone. I do not know which ones have been added for certain - but I learned the hard way before that I cannot simply disable or stop GPS tracking on the phone or I will be punished for that.    **Is there a way to (1) secretly disable the tracking apps and (2) still make it record/audit like the apps are still running?**   I have not had him as a bf or anything for many years, but he's constantly still around. He still uses me for watching the kids he has with his previous ex.. and he has access to my banking and money so its necessary for him to make sure I'm not going to change too much.   But if someone can help with this app question, it would be really appreciated because I would like the chance to drive to a new job interview without having to get permission first (since I know the question would open up all kinds of issues).   If I should ask there somewhere else, I will. Thank you very much for your help."
emotional,Texting?,"Hi All   So, in my situation I'm living with my boyfriend and I wanted your opinion. From when we first met a year ago - until a month or so ago, he would message me back almost straight away, and with details and pictures as he was going about his day. Now, I'm lucky to get a text reply at all when he is outside of the house. Unfortunately, and I'm not proud of it, this seems to have triggered my attachment anxiety in this relationship. Again, I'm not proud of it, I will end up sending him a series of pleading text messages trying to get him to reply to me. He will then reply hours and hours later, or sometimes the next day if he is staying at a friends, saying that I am a psychopath for sending more than one message as he is busy, and its not a priority. Last night, I messaged him around 5pm asking when he would be back from work so I could organise dinner. And he didn't reply until he was back in our part of town getting off the subway. He called me nuts for messaging him 5 times to ask when he was back. I know I shouldn't message so much if he isn't replying, but I really can't seem to help it, and I can't seem to deal with this change in texting behaviour from him. Has anyone else had a similar situation?"
emotional,"therapist says this isn't abuse - please help, distraught","Hi all  I dated my ex for two months.  In the beginning he said I was perfect, a princess, with a perfect soul, that he loved every inch of my body, etc, etc.  Our first problem was when I sent him a flirty text that said ""we're only having sex if you earn it, bad boy."" with a sexy pic.  The next day he was infuriated. He said I should never, ever joke about withholding sex. He made me buy a round of drinks and was angry for the rest of the night, until we made love and I held him and kissed him.  We had another issue when we spent the weekend together. I texted him the next day and said ""hey! Do you think we could change our plans for Thursday? Perhaps we could do something else, xx"" and he started calling me about 3x. I didn't answer. I said I wasn't feeling well, and that I would call him in a few days. When I called him he was shaking with anger, and said he needed me to be more dependable and do more, to prove I wasn't just ""a gold digger"" who was using him.  The last straw was when I texted ""goodnight,"" and turned my phone off. The next day he brought all my things and would barely talk to me, or kiss me, and said that I obviously didn't understand what communication he needed.  We also had one small issue when in bed after being intimate, he started physically pushing me to leave and use the bathroom. He would poke, push, and eventually give me little slaps on my legs to make sure that I left.   We broke up and he said we could only talk in 4 weeks, and that we could only be platonic until then. it has been torture.  I'm so confused. I'm in therapy and my therapist says it's not abuse. But I know I started the relationship a confident woman, and I feel very confused, and distraught right now."
physical,Student stuck at home during quarantine with abusive family. Any concrete ways to get out of the situation safely and in a way where I can support myself?,"Hi all! Sorry for the lack of formatting; I__ writing this on my phone. I__ desperate for answers and need help ASAP.   With coronavirus, many students are forced to live at home (I have been) even though I have an abusive family situation. The abuse was worse when I was younger, but still persists in less physical ways.   I have been going to therapy for years and I am fully aware of the gaslighting that takes place on a daily basis at my household. But, even though, I__e been to therapy for years and am actually registered at a domestic violence shelter to be able to go there at any time, I know that if I leave I will essentially be on my own forever. And I am so financially dependent on my family that I cannot do that because I live in a foreign country (I don__ speak the language). My therapist has told me to wait it out. But, I find that to be bullshit. I feel like the longer I stay, the more I become a mere shell of a person or of who I once was.   Does anyone have any concrete solutions or steps they took to make themselves independent from controlling/abusive family members?  Thank you so much   TLDR: I__ a student stuck in an abusive family situation with no way out, not even my therapist can help me."
physical,After being physically abused by my father I finally see that our relationship was never going well,"Hi all, I am mainly posting this just to get it off my chest so please don't feel the need to reply or comfort me but of course that is welcome. I'm also open to reading other peoples opinions on the situation. I'm always very curious about others opinions. Anyway...  So after being physically abused by my father I've finally realised that we never had the best relationship. I have done reading about the cycle of abuse today and it is scarily similar to what I have been experiencing at home since I decided to live with my father rather than my mother. He would always shout at me, calling me a waste of a son and making empty threats about kicking me out, saying how he expects me to die as a drug abuser (I have never even used a class A drug in my life) and just what I consider the usual stuff he says. He would then give it a couple of days and apologise saying that he only gets angry because he loves me so much and it upsets him seeing me do bad at school (usually how the verbal abuse begins. He would get an email from school saying I have missed work then he would storm into my room and shout at me then take away all my belongings apart from clothes and my bed. If you are wondering why I don't do well in school it's because I find it very difficult to motivate myself and also stay focused on my work)  So a couple nights ago I decided to actually respond back. Normally I sit quietly and endure what he is saying but I spoke back to him. I called him a phrase that I knew would get on his nerves because its something he is insecure about. He then asks me to apologise and I say no. This is when the physical abuse happens. First he pushed me and I tripped on a draw that was open and fell onto the floor, he then gave it maybe 1 or 1.5 seconds and the look on his face. It was like he was a different man completely.  He started punching me while I was on my back speaking but all I could hear was the impacts of his fists. My stepmum got between us and I stood up. I grabbed my dad over her and punched him twice before holding my hands up saying I'm stopping. L my stepmum then puts ME in a restraining hold that she learnt from being a mental health ward nurse. Again I was back on the floor. They called me insane and that I need to leave immediately. I got my phone back (my dad left it in an easy to grab space so when I was let go I ran for it) called the police and now a lot of things are happening but basically I'm going to stay with my mum in Spain I just need to get my passport from him which my sister said she will do ( currently staying at hers)  He does have a violent past and multiple arrests for domestic violence (both with my mother and stepmother). Court ruled he should go to anger management but he never did. I just can't believe I never even considered emotional abuse to be a thing that happens. I was aware of it but always thought that I had a short tempered father and that it was normal. Its kind of messy at the moment getting my flights sorted with school and everything but yeah I'm finally moving away. Again just wanted to get this off of my chest. He did text me the day after apologising for what he said but won't admit to hitting me over text which I assume could be because he knows the police are involved. Doesn't matter though I'm not going to try get him arrested again I just want to get to my mums.   Anyway that's what's going on with me,  the random guy on reddit. Hope you all have a good time today and feel free to DM me about anything or if you want somebody to talk to I don't mind. People tell me I'm a good listener but idk if that translates well over text.   Thank you."
emotional,Out for 9 months but still struggling,"Hi all. I don't really have a specific ask here, I just wanted to kind of put a post out there and hear what people have to say.  At the beginning of march I ended an 8-year emotionally abusive romantic relationship. There were so many obvious and not-so-obvious red flags almost from the beginning of the relationship. I'm normally a person who doesn't really get mad at things, but almost from the beginning we would get in so many fights that either ended in screaming or me uncontrollably sobbing because I felt like I just couldn't get him to understand what I was trying to say and I would get so frustrated I would get to the point where I just broke. During these fights he would often break things (never any of his own things - always my things or things that represented our relationship like a picture) or punch holes in doors.  He did other little stuff too. For example, he would put his hand on the back of my neck while we were out in public even though I'd told him I didn't like it and then defend himself by saying he was 'just joking.'  I think, and no joke, the last five years of the relationship I didn't hang out with friends EVER. He would get so upset when I would want to go out and hang out with my friends, but would also never come with me because he was 'convinced' my friends didn't like him or didn't make enough of an effort to include him.  Once I tried to remind him of a time we got pizza from a specific pizza place and instead of saying he didn't remember he would argue that it never happened. I gave him so many specific details about the day to try to convince him it happened and he just didn't remember, but he was still adamant that it never happened.  HE MISSED MY FREAKING PHD DEFENSE BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T TAKE THE BUS WITH ME THAT MORNING, THEN LEFT HOME TOO LATE AND COULDN'T FIND PARKING.  Those are just a few examples, but I could go on for pages.  In the few months afterwords I struggled with almost weekly insane panic attacks - the only way I can describe them is that I either felt like I was going to die or that the world wasn't real. Those have gotten way better and more infrequent, but I still have moments at least every week or two where I just start crying and it's really hard to stop. Sometimes it's about a specific memory and sometimes it's not.  I met a wonderful man in June and we started dating more seriously in mid July (lol the timing was such shit - I wish I could have met him 3 years from now when I'm feeling a bit more healed from the abuse, but I guess you don't get to decide those things). He's been super great and supportive, but I still feel so crappy putting a lot of my negative emotions on him. It's easier to deal with when it's something really specific - for example we went on a covid-safe weekend trip and I forgot my toothbrush. In my past relationship this would have been a huge issue most likely leading to an explosive and day ruining fight. My new guy was just calmly like, 'oh, we'll just go to the grocery store and pick one up tomorrow.' I LOST it that night because it was such a nice and normal thing to say, but I was able to explain exactly what had set me off. I have a much harder time when I'm just feeling a sort of swirl of negative emotions that I can tell are caused by the old relationship but not by one easily explainable memory or circumstance so I always feel really bad when I break down crying and can't really explain why.  I'm also just so frustrated that rationally I'm ready to be completely moved on from the old relationship, but whatever weird, lingering anxiety/ptsd/whatever isn't done with me."
physical,Flashbacks to childhood,"Hi everyone  Does anyone else still hear their parents verbal abuse of each other? I found that In my relationships I've continued in my parents footsteps trying to recreate the same toxic environment. After taking a break from dating, I've found that those old memories are always playing in my mind. Has anyone else gotten it to stop?  Thank you!"
emotional,I'm So Confused...,"Hi everyone,  I'm not sure how to start this, so for now I'll gloss over my story of abuse. I might post about it again here just to vent but right now, I think I just need some support or advice. I found out in March that my abuser moved on and found a new girlfriend and it has been bothering me ever since. I don't know exactly how I feel about it. Am I worried for their new girlfriend? Do I have a responsibility to warn her about what her partner is like? Does my abuser treat their girlfriend better than they did me? Do I still wish that my abuser liked me? All these questions run through my head every time I think about them. I feel like I'm crazy because my abuser seems happy with their new girlfriend. I know I don't want them back nor am I jealous because I'm in a very healthy, loving relationship right now. Has anyone else dealt with this? Is it normal to be bothered by this?"
emotional,"Feeling bad about missing my ex, and in a thought spiral of wondering if he ever loved me :/","Hi everyone, I (20F) broke up with my (27M) boyfriend back in September of 2020. The relationship started when I was 19 and lasted for 8 months. We met through a mutual club and got together throw hooking up for a couple of months, and the first two months were amazing, then I had some health issues, and he chose to go day drinking with his friends than to take me to my appointment for an MRI/CT scan for cancer (no cancer) and that__ when I should have left, but I didn__. It got worse as he compared me to his ex, saying she had a huge ass, she was better at a said hobby than me, and as I found out that she was on his Spotify and on his Netflix and still messaged him on social media, even though he called her crazy and said she was the abusive one, not him. He would tell me all the time how he was polyamorous (nothing wrong with that!) but he would use it against me by saying that one day if I stopped meeting his sexual needs he might find someone else, or that he might randomly decide I was not enough for him, (his words not mine)  I really should have left.  I look back and I feel so much pain for my younger self.   It was my first relationship; the first time a guy had really done the bare minimum for me and I was so so so co-dependent. It was so hard to leave.  I tried to leave 3 times before the final breakup and he would either physically restrain me/keep me from leaving, (during an argument I had gotten an Uber to go home and he had blocked the door with his couch and wouldn__ let me leave) or beg and cry and tell me I was throwing our whole relationship away, at one point over quarantine (I was isolated with him) I had downed a bottle of wine and was sleeping on the couch, and he took me to our room and had sex with me while I was sleeping, and then asked me if I had consented.   I am still in therapy, I have been for 5 years, and this is something we have worked on, talked about, I have all the bad memories written down to remind myself of how it was, talking about it makes it more real  I have moved on from him emotionally, the trauma resurfaced after seeing him today, and a trigger of mine was also activated when I was at home.  Today is the anniversary of my father taking his life 6 years ago, and him and my ex were very similar in terms of personality. I realized that I sought out the same dysfunctional relationship I had with my dad, in my ex. I used to have nightmares of my dad either being alive or talking about how he didn__ want me, and now the figure in those dreams is my ex.  I wanted to prove that I was worthy of love to someone who didn__ want me. Basically. Even having said all of this, a very desperate version of myself is wishing he wanted me, and idk why I want him to approve of me so so badly, when he didn__ even respect me, but if anyone has any words of encouragement, similar stories, advice, anything etc please lmk."
emotional,How to move forward with my life?,"Hi everyone, I__e never posted on here before but I__ just feeling so defeated and need some objective advice.   I [F] had a boyfriend for approx. two years, and about 5 months of it at the end was long distance as he went away to school after taking a year off to have surgery and recover. I was there every step of the way during his surgery/rehab, low moments, recovery and we were doing great. His family absolutely adored me, which at the time made me feel really good to be so accepted/welcomed. However, he got better and started cheating on me with exes, and other girls I didn__ know. Once we were long distance, it became frequent. At one point, I was sitting in the living room visiting with his family and I received a photo of him kissing another girl. I was hysterical and it was absolutely humiliating. Come to find out his family knew, and had actually met with the girl over FaceTime and kept it from me. His mother__ excuse was that it was just a fling and that everyone knew I was the girl he would end up with. I stupidly believed it, forgave him, and carried on with the relationship. About two months later he came home for the holidays, and just days before I was supposed to go on a trip with his family, he was hiding his phone from me, intentionally smiling and laughing at texts and looking for my reaction. I finally had enough courage to ask him flat out if he was seeing someone. He said yes, that he was talking to a girl he met at college and was really interested in her. I ended things between us immediately, however, his family made me feel terrible that they had paid for my flight and hotel and how it was a waste of everybody__ __ard-earned money_, and being the pushover I am, I made the stupidest decision to go on the trip anyway. I lasted about a day feeling heartbroken watching the person I loved constantly in contact with this other girl. I finally put on my big girl pants, packed up all my things, got an Uber and put myself on the next flight home. My flight landed, I was deleted off of everything, blocked, and not a single member of their family or himself checked in to see if I got home safe.   I was 22 at the time, and  it__ been almost a year and a half, but I__e just never really been able to move past the hurt from this situation. I was constantly told that I was over-emotional and had a tendency to blow things out of proportion by him and his family, and now I find myself second guessing my judgement and decisions, and constantly trying to reassure myself that the way he treated me was indeed messed up.   I constantly look him, the other girls (who have really done nothing wrong), and his family members up on social media, and feel excited when I see bad news from them. I don__ know why I can__ just move on, but I constantly have flashbacks to moments where I was humiliated in front of his family, and vividly remember things that he said about my appearance or character flaws, and can__ help but replay it over and over. I find myself holding back tears reliving these moments on a daily basis even though I haven__ spoken to any of them in so long.    I just don__ know build up my self worth after having it shattered to pieces, and move forward with my life.   P.s. It was extremely therapeutic to see it all written out instead of being a jumbled mess in my head."
emotional,How to move forward with my life?,"Hi everyone, I__e never posted on here before but I__ just feeling so defeated and need some objective advice.   I [F] had a boyfriend for approx. two years, and about 5 months of it at the end was long distance as he went away to school after taking a year off to have surgery and recover.

physical,Drink girlfriend now ex,"Hi everyone, my now ex girlfriend got dunk on Saturday 17/07/2021 to the point she couldn__ walk. I had to take her home in an Uber and shortly after we got inside she vomited on my bed the floor and my feet, I stood patiently waiting for her to finish and carried her to the kitchen sink. She continued to vomit while I tried to clean the original mess and soon after I carried her to the bathroom took her dress off and told her to shower because she had vomit all over her. She had finished in the shower and had come back to my room, I told her to sit down and be quiet while I cleaned because I was pretty annoyed and upset, she took offence and we started arguing. (Even though she had vomited half a dozen times already she was still super drunk, aggressive and emotional) things escalated quickly as we argued and eventually she punched me in the face and scratched me all over my upper body. I retaliated and grabed her by the neck, pinning her on the bed and told her to stop and calm down. She continued to hit me and at some point during the whole ordeal she punched and destroyed my tv gifted to my by my cousin. After she did that I grabed her and threw her on the bed telling her to stop.  (I__l have to add a part II later have to get back to work, will also clarify any misunderstandings)  TLDR:  Girlfriend got drunk, was extremely volatile and aggressive, punched and scratched me, destroyed my TV and shortly doing so tried to cut herself with a Stanley knife, vomited on my bed, floor and my feet.  I just need guidance, I__ broken. Not only have I lost a girl i wanted a future with but now I must deal with the ramifications of this situation."
emotional,Emotional Abuse in a Pandemic,"Hi everyone. I hope you're all well. I was wondering if any of you had tips on how to overcome an emotional abusive relationship within the confines of a pandemic and lockdown. After being isolated from my friends and family over the past few years and after taking so many hits to my mental health, self-esteem, and well-being, I sometimes feel tempted to go back to my ex. It makes me feel especially vulnerable knowing they're living their best lives after leaving me with nothing. I wish I could post more explaining the details. It almost feels like I have to depend on my ex who wanted me to have nothing and I don't know how to get past that."
emotional,Plz say your feeling about this words,"Hi Guys, May I ask, if some guy post __n your day, I hope you DO SOMETHING that brings you joy WITH SOMEONE that brings you joy!_ Is this mean something? Do they feel I__ unhappy? I got married, they know that, my marriage is good, I always looks happy. Hope just I thought too much. Thanks"
emotional,Was I emotionally abused by my dad?,"Hi I (21f) have been going on a downward spiral lately, especially since my father died late last year.   I loved him deeply, but have been wondering if what he used to do could be considered as emotional abuse.   If I ever got in trouble I was never __unished_ like other kids were (groundings, spankings, curfew) I was screamed at. And when I say screamed at I mean sat at a table and verbally berated for upwards of an hour and a half until I cried, or ( later in life) just went blank. I was often called stupid, careless, lazy, disgusting, etc; and basically forced to concede to his viewpoints. He also used this tactic to make me do things in life that he thought I should do. He basically picked out what path I had to take at school and even my career (which I am currently employed).  If I wasn__ being yelled at I was often called names or had comments made mostly centred around my weight and appearance which were passed off as a joke when I started to get irritated. He used to intentionally push my buttons or bring up events that he new made me upset and joke about them (often involving my siblings and letting them make comments) until I was fuming and talked back, then got me in trouble for being disrespectful.  I was praised when I __idn__ make_ him yell at me for a longer than normal period of time.  Sometimes he and his friends ( military guys ) would also make fun of me and make comments.   But I__e got to add that I absolutely did love my father and we had a lot of fun when he was still around.  There were so many good times with the bad that even thinking of this as abuse causes my head to spin.  Recently I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and have been having trouble coping, as well as making personal connections to people. I was wondering if this may be the cause?   I love my dad, but I think he fucked me up."
physical,Some advice,Hi so I have a friend she__ a girl a very nice girl very sweet wouldn__ harm or do anything wrong to any guy and she__ with someone who is abusing her this might be the third time he__ put his hands on her leaving marks this time I told her the first time that he will do it again for sure and I wasn__ wrong she is was too stupid to leave him even though I have offered her to stay with me until she figures it out what can I do? I wanna harm this guy in some way or do something to him to really make him learn his lesson cause he__ gonna beat his next girlfriend even if she does leave him I don__ want any other girl to go through this so what can I do LEGALLY to him please any help would be great
emotional,Don__ know how to have a relationship with my emotionally abusive father,"Hi so this is my first time making a post here but I honestly don__ know what to do anymore. The abuse I__e experienced does not compare at all to what Ive seen on this sub but I__ still stuck in a somewhat toxic situation. Since I was a child my dad always finds a way to get angry at me. I never knew when he was going to get upset or what to do to stop him from getting upset. He would turn every conversation I had with him into a fight. He got even angrier when I cried. Eventually when I was 10 I realized the only way to stop getting yelled at was to stop talking to him or to give him short answers or try to give him an answer to something that wouldn__ piss him off. I was able to move out so things got better because he couldnt yell at me as much over the phone but I had to move back home because of covid. Now he wants to have a relationship with me and his anger has lessened but i just cant trust him. In the past i would trust him, he would eventually get upset over something small and I would get hurt. I cant trust that this wont happen again. The problem is he controls my finances and pays for everything. Im still in school and i have a good relationship with his side of the family and with my mom so its not like i can leave. He demands that i show him love and affection and that we have to have a normal father daughter relationship. What do i do? Do i trust him again? How do i trust someone whose hurt me so much in the past. Do i fake being good to him to keep the peace? I suck at faking my emotions the only thing im capable of is giving an emotionless response but its hard for me to show love when i dont feel it. Leaving is not an option. Please can anyone tell me what i should to to keep him happy? Im moving out in may btw so i need to keep him happy until then (hes paying my rent) sorry this is so long thanks in advance!"
physical,"Husband of 4 Years, Verbal, Emotional, Financial Abuse. How do I get out.","Hi ya'll, I've been married for 4 years, almost 5, with a 2 year old kiddo.  My husband has gotten progressively more emotionally, verbally and financially abusive. His anger issues have gotten worse and worse as well.  I'm scared if I take our baby and go he'll call the police and say I kidnapped her. That's the main thing holding me back, and I can't find anything online about it.  He's threatened to kill himself in front of me multiple times, once forcing me to wrestle a gun from his hand.    We got in a fight a few weeks ago, and he told me ""Are you trying to get punched"". It scared the shit out of me.   Whenever we get in arguments, he uses things I tell him in confidence to hurt me. Especially PTSD related things.   He mocks my trauma, my mental illness, and has told me so many times how I do nothing for the household- even though I raise our child pretty much by myself.  He makes me feel so worthless. And when I tried to tell him these things and how they make me feel, he tells me I'm the abuser. He tells me I'm just misinterpreting things. Maybe I am the abuser. I don't know anymore. I feel so conflicted and sad.  I want to be ok. I just want her to be ok. I've considered suicide so many times, and the only thing keeping me alive is my baby. I need to get her away from him before he actually hurts us."
emotional,Therapy,"Hi! My mother and i have been emotionally abused by my father for as long as i can remember. It took me a really long time to understand that the constant yelling, degrading and name calling was in fact abuse and for some reason i thought that it was normal, and that everyone__ father talked like that. I never told anyone about it, even when what he said and did didn__ sit right with me. Don__ get me wrong, i come from a privileged background with a lot of money and opportunities, and therefore this always felt like a _«luxury-problem_», and i told myself that _«it__ not really that bad when he gives you so much money_». But who tells their wife multiple times that it would be better if she killed herself?  Although i__e moved away to study, there are days where it all just gets to me and i can__ focus on anything. I__ writing this post because idk if i should seek therapy. I keep doubting if this really is a problem, or if I__ overreacting."
emotional,Is my family emotionally abusive?,"Hi! My name is R. I am 18-years-old and am about to go to college. I recently have started my journey in realizing I might live with emotionally abusive parents. However, I don__ know whether I am dramatizing what happens in my family or if it is actually normal. If you could help me in providing me with advice on whether this is just a couple of iffy parenting moments or if it__ an emotional abusive family.   Firstly, the main thing that led me to believe I might be in a emotionally abusive situation is that as a 18 year-old (soon to be on college and out of the house thank god) with ADHD and GAD, I am not __llowed_ to have breakdowns or panic attacks. If I do have a break/attack due to school, friends, etc, I am belittled and yelled at like it__ an awful thing. I cannot cry nor express my stresses without being told that i am being overdramatic, need to grow up, or acting like an insane person (if i am having an attack). Equally, my mother will normally just scream about how ungrateful I am and how i have ruined her day after she has worked her ass off at work. So, I__e quite literally learned to cry and have anxiety attacks quietly as to avoid getting belittled and making the attack worse. (Trigger warning: gore) For example, I once went to the fair and saw a man who had skin cancer and was fresh out of surgery. My mom even commented on the fact he was probably close to death as he looked like a corpse with skin stitched around his face. For some reason (nothing against the man), the thought of dying, gore, etc, made my anxiety sky-rocket. I thought the crowd was gonna kill me or I was going to get stabbed. My step-dad (who is my father figure), tried to hug me during this because he realized I was freaking out. I then told him politely that I don__ want to be touched right now. My mom and step-dad took this personally and remarked about how I ruined the day for everyone. This made me start crying and they promptly left the fair while berating me about how I make it all about me and how they don__ want to talk about getting me help because my mother __idn__ want to feed into that anymore_.  Also, I was diagnosed with both ADHD and GAD when I was around seven.   Additionally, my step-dad is a micromanager. If I don__ do something exactly how he wants it or if he is just in a bad mood, I will get told that I am stupid, an idiot, that I didn__ take my medication, sworn at, and blamed. For instance, I put dried dish rags on top of the dryer when I was washing my clothes. When he came home, he yelled at me for being lazy and not taking my time (even though I did all my laundry and put the dish rags on top because I didn__ want to put them away wrong and be yelled at for that). He threw my clean clothes out of the dryer and tossed them into the garage to be cleaned again. This whole time I have to not cry or fidget with my hands because i am apparently __aking it/nervous because I know I did something wrong_. Even though I fidget to distract myself from his yelling.   Lastly, out of the many other things, we aren__ allowed to say anything that opposes my step-dads opinion or else it will end in me crying while he yells at me. He is always right and my mom will even step in and tell me to shut up and be smarter than that whenever he starts to get mad over me saying something like __hy don__ you try moving it over there?_ or __et me Google that real quick, I think that__ not right_. This argumentative style has led to holes in walls and door handles being broken.   So anyways, I know it__ not a normal family but I just learned about gaslighting and I think I have been told that this has been because of hard my parents work. So, it__ taken awhile for me to doubt it as I didn__ want to come after their hard work.   If you have any insight whether this is emotional abusive or not or any other signs, I__ love to her. Additionally, any advice would be appreciated as I start my journey on getting help and leaving my family as I go to college."
physical,wtf is going on,"Hi,  I am looking for some insight, if anyone can help me.  First and foremost, I had an affair with a coworker. It was short, we ended it because we knew it wasn't sustainable, and I hated lying to my husband so I confessed to him.  I know it has been devastating to him. We are now in couples counselling, although we are just barely getting to the treatment phase. I am also in individual counselling.   Since confessing to my husband, we have had multiple escalated episodes. Most often he yells at me and swears at me. Sometimes he calls me names like ""whore"" and ""slut"". He often tells me that I don't understand what he's going through (which is most likely true). Often our son is sleeping across the hall and I tell him not to raise his voice which makes him angrier. He'll then tell me it's my fault because I had the affair and I made him so emotional. But these kinds of outbursts did happen before my affair as well, they were just much less frequent.  When he gets mad he often criticizes how I spend money, how I spend my time when I'm not working, how I keep house or don't, or that I'm tired all the time and he doesn't understand why. But it's when he's angry. When he's calm he's very sweet and supportive. But I just never know when it's going to flip.  At some point he read my journal and then became very hurt because my writings were not very sympathetic to him, and I wrote about missing my affair partner. So now he has an expectation for me to make up for what he read in my private journal by helping him ""rewrite the narrative.""  In our most recent argument, about a week ago, he became enraged and asked me how my coworker and I ""did it."" I was sitting in bed and my husband climbed on top of me and grabbed me by the shoulders yelling ""Was it like this??"" I pushed him off and told him to stop, but the argument kept going for a while... He said ""I'm sorry for getting violent but what you did to me was an act of violence."" He said I could have killed him and our son because I had been intimate with a man who is not vaccinated against COVID, and because we had unprotected sex. And look, I'm not going to try to defend my choices to have and affair and to have unprotected sex. My affair partner told me his sexual history and I took him at his word, but that doesn't justify it.  My husband often defends his actions by saying he doesn't have the skills for dealing with all the emotions, and that he's too busy with work to do any work on himself or self-care. He has a stressful job and works long hours.  I've told all of this to my therapist, and she has been alarmed by the number of red flags.... yelling, swearing, reading my private journal, criticizing me, the uncertainty, walking on eggshells, and then grabbing me. She has urged me to have a safety plan in case my son and I need to leave.  So this has all been going on for about 3 months. Like I said, our last big argument where it got physical was about a week ago. Since then he has had days where he has been able to self-regulate and not explode at me. Obviously he is apologetic. But I'm still scared. He wants to work on the marriage and move past the affair. He wants me to make an effort to right the wrongs I've done to him. But I just don't know how to feel. I know I betrayed him and broke his trust in me but I have lost my trust in him as well.  Obviously our relationship has been toxic. And having an affair is a form of abuse as well, so I know I am not the only victim in this situation. But how long do I give us to fix things? Is his abuse justified given what I've done? Some websites say that since I had an affair, I need to give up my right to privacy in order to rebuild my husband's trust in me. Does that extend to my private journal? Things seem to be getting better, granted it's only been a week, but from what I've read and been told by my therapist, abuse almost always escalates.   I've made a promise to myself to leave if he gets physically violent with me again. But besides that I am having a hard time feeling invested in this marriage. I wish I wanted to fix it, specifically for our son, but I feel like I'm just waiting for the next bad thing to happen.  Thanks for reading. I'm sorry this is so long."
physical,When can the police decide to pursue without you? Does it ever happen?,"Hi,  I want to report my ex abuser to the police. I'm not sure whether I want to go for prosecution yet, and they may tell me there is not much evidence but as usual (victim feeling shameful) I want to tell them everything and scared they will want to pursue a case with or without my consent? Anyone got experience with this? What was the outcome?"
physical,Is this abusive of the guy I'm dating?,"Hi,  I'm dating a guy for some time now, and he is a jealous and possessive type of person. When my phone rings or I get messages, he gets often upset, nearly shouting at me, telling me to turn off the notifications. He justified it a few times by saying he wants to focus on the movie or how I'll walk against a light pole if I stare too much at my phone, but he also seems to get upset whenever I am busy replying to messages. When I don't comply and try to argue against it, he suddenly gets a very dominant and almost militaristic tone, repeating what he said: ""Turn it off.""   He is 14 years older than me (I'm 21)."
emotional,Will therapy help me get over emotional abuse,"Hi, every I was emotionally abused for a year by an ex. I can not date or even have intimate sessions with myself because of him. I also suffer from OCD and it's 20 times worse due to the abuse that I allowed in my life.  I find it hard to move on because I think all men will judge me over my actions. I am often anxious, nervous, and scared about everything. Before I met him, I was happy, carefree, full of life. I dated without feeling judged, and I was able to have intimate fantasies with myself without judging my thoughts or myself over my fantasies. When I met him, I confided in him and shared so much about myself with him. He judged me and belittle me. It was like I had to walk on eggshells while dating him. Sadly, that fear seeped over into my life and now I am single and have fear of everything. I am so scared of any and everything and it gets worse on my period._"
emotional,From fucked up childhood to established model,"Hi, I just kinda wanna get everything of my chest so I__l tell a bunch of random people my life story hoping it will make me feel better. My mom and and dad separated before I was born and to be honest idk if he even knew I existed til my mom had a breakdown one I was a few months old and social services contacted him. Before I start telling you about my dad it__ important to know that he had it rough as a kid. He grew up in Africa and witnessed some pretty fucked up shit in army and when his mom passed away his whole world shattered. After the army he got hired to work pretty high up in the US and also saw and had to do pretty fucked up things.   Anyways when he moved to Europe he first married my brothers mom and she left him because he was emotional abusive (screaming and having a temper) and was horrible to her kids. Then he met my mom they hooked up, moved in together and then broke things of. So when I was a kid a lived 50% at moms and 50% at dads. My mom was mentally ill plus very conservative leading to her spanking me every time I did something wrong. My dad and his wife were loving towards me about 65% of the time and 35% abusive.   My dad is also btw super manipulative which I as a kid didn__ notice at the time. Because my father was loving and also very manipulative I loved him even if he spanked me and screamed at me and my younger siblings. Important to note my 10 year older brother lived with his supersweet mom and because of this he could have a pretty nice and normal childhood. Anyways fast forward to me turning 4. Apparently my mom and her boyfriend wanted custody over me and they had social services and their lawyer on their side. I told social services several times that I didn__ wanna live at my moms. I hated her she was just as abusive as my dad but unlike him she showed zero love.   My stepmom walks in to my room one day and tells me she, my dad , my little brother and sister were moving from Europe to fricking Canda and that I had to stay here with my mom. I started crying and she started crying. My dad felt like if he didn__ have custody over me he had no reason to stay in Europe. So they left me at my moms and left the country. I was heart broken and my mom got more ill and started abusing me more. She stopped taking me to kindergarten so my kindergarten teacher got concerned and called my mom.   She one day got a nervous break down and she tried to keep social services from coming into our apartment. So the police came and they arrested her and I just remember her telling me to run. Which I didn__ lol. Anyways she is taking to the hospital and I sit in the waiting room at the hospital. A lady at the social services came to so me and told me that my mom was now calm and I could go meet her now if I wanted to. I told her that I didn__ want to see my mother, everything was just so scary and weird.   Next thing I know my older brothers mom picks me up and takes me home to her and I meet my older brother again. I__e never been this happy in my life!! I got to move to her when I was about to turn six. And everything was amazing til I turned 10. I had a bit of a temper at this age. I missed my dad and I used to get really pissed of easily at her. And the thing is she was extremely kind and could never really lay a finger on me and she didn__ know how to discipline me.   She wasn__ doing great either, she smoked, drank wine quite often (but didn__ have a drinking problem) and she didn__ always feed me bc she couldn__ really afford it. The food I ate was pretty unhealthy and ate candy like all the time. But I was very skinny (not underweight but almost. She called social services and told them she couldn__ deal with me and that I needed a new family. My dad was pissed because he apparently had a plan to come back and hopefully get full custody of me. I got to live with a foster family for a year which wasn__ bad but I missed my dad, stepmom and siblings a lot!!   My dad and family comes back at my 11th birthday and I get to live with him. What I suppressed was that my dad loved money. My foster parents and I had saved about 1800 dollars for my future and they gave it to him. And he bet it all. My dad wanted to reunite the family so he made sure my older brother who is 10 years older moved in with us and my older brother payed for a lot around the house. My dad was very nice in the beginning but then he got super strict. I had to have straight A:s and B:s, I could no longer walk around the house with a sports bra and shorts and had to cover myself because he and my step mom were/are super conservative. He no longer slapped or spanked me though because he thought that I__ go to the cops. Moving in with him was horrible, he slapped my 2 year young brother when he asked for a phone or computer or stuff in general. He also slapped my 4 year younger sister. If we did anything __rong_ like spilling water or dropped our phones he__ scream and call us names. We never got to hang out with friends or go out and I hated my life.  I__e wanted to kill myself so many times but I__e really hanged in there. I__ praying he gets his karma. He always said when you guys turn 18 you can do what ever you want. So the second year of high school when I turned 18 I literally asked if could go home to a friend (for the second time in a row) and he got pissed and said no. He told me I was changing and he needed to keep me grounded so I wouldn__ end up like a __ad_ kid. I had enough, I packed my bags and moved back to my older brothers mom.   And my dad told me I wasn__ he__ daughter and a bunch of shit. I was hurt af but nothing was going to ruin my last to years of high school. He eventually came around and said it was fine as long as I called him once every week. The funny thing is no one in high school would ever figure out that this is my life. Most people thought that I was a shallow __opular_ girl. It__ just weird that you never know what other people are going through.   My older brothers mom kicked me out because of COVID, she was really afraid of getting it so she thought kicking me out would make it more safe for her. Anyways I__ 20 and I have my own student apartment because I study HR but I live at my dads house atm. Which sucks because he Is still very misogynistic, mean and emotional abusive. But I__e started acting and I__ now a pretty well established model acutually which is why I have to be at his house because it is super central. The issue is my right now is I kinda make anything from 500 dollar to 7000 dollars per day working as a model/actress and my dad and step mom are a bit under middle class.

physical,Help finding a safe way to call for help? (background story included),"Hi, reader. I'm in my late 20's and am a caretaker for both my disabled mother (63) and brother (24). We live in a midwestern state in the US. I've been actively looking for help for about 2 years for myself and my family but Covid has made things nearly unbearable and it's finally reached a breaking point. My father (53), our abuser (married to my mom for 28 years), has finally decided to leave the home because he's sick of having to pay rent for my us (my mom, brother, and myself). This is a good thing of course. He spent all the time since the Covid outbreak going out. He's an alcoholic and nearly daily came home drunk and angry or high, only really slept here sometimes, and didn't want to wear a mask around us. He frequently spoke to his mistresses on the phone around us, complaining about us to them. This is the least of his abuse, but it's relevant.   When he got Covid he decided to quarantine with one of his many mistresses, a woman who mocked and laughed at us frequently on the phone with him. He came back a month after his diagnosis, showed me the recent test results he got which were negative, and came into the house. He grabbed a few things and said he was sick of us and that since he was finally living the life he wanted to live with his mistress, he was leaving for good. He also said she questioned why he was even still paying for our phone lines since we don't deserve to have phone access, so he's thinking of cutting those off.   Ever since I started looking into getting help for our situation, the main problems I've come across have been the fact that my mom can't accompany me to the places I have had to go because she's bedridden, and the second is that he pays for our phones and has made it very clear he monitors our outgoing and incoming calls. Obviously he doesn't know what we talk about, but he knows what numbers we call and for how long we talk. This makes calling any hotline or specific help numbers (law offices, department of aging/disabilities etc) very hard.   I'm trying to find out if anyone here has any suggestions as to how to make secure calls. I have a burner phone, but I haven't been able to buy minutes for it. Now that feels impossible, since I have to come up with a way to make rent money and I'm honestly in a panic about that, since I haven't been able to work due to fear of leaving my mom and brother alone with him and a lack of time because caring for them is a 24/7 job. We pay for the rest of the bills and food and barely make it to the end of the month, but the added burden of rent is what's scaring the soul out of me. I have no idea if we're going to be homeless in a month or two since we have no family or friends.   I know I can make a lot of progress if only I can start making calls, but his monitoring is what scares me most. I can now make calls freely since he's not here anymore, but if he finds out about the numbers I've been calling, it might push him to make a radical decision. He's threatened to burn down the apartment before and still has keys to the place, so he can come back at any time even though he's stated that he doesn't want to. I don't think he'll go that far, but he's unpredictable  right now and I'd rather not risk anything.  So my main questions I guess: Are there any alternatives to making calls that don't show up on phone bills? Do outgoing Google Voice calls, for example, show up on t-mobile phone bills? Any idea anyone can think of that might help with this situation in general?  If you go this far, thank you.   Even if you have no suggestions, thanks for reading."
physical,ESA certification?,"Hi, So recently I have found a stable place for me and my son after having left my abuser 6+ months ago. It was extremely hard, but I worked hard to get a place. There is only one problem... 2 weeks out of the month I will be living alone. My place doesn't allow pets but I've considered getting a pet and getting it certified. My abuser has destroyed my mentality and I still have days where I struggle. There are some things that cause me to trigger horribly and I don't know if it would be good to go through that alone. Any advice or guidance would be appreciated. I have never lived alone either so this is very new to me. I'm not sure how well I will take without some type of support."
physical,"My Abuse Story (Redacted some parts to abide by guidelines, my apologies mods)","Hi, the next several paragraphs are going to be a detailed account of the abuse I went through with my partner. This is simply for me, I need to write it out from beginning to end to fully understand what happened to me and to move on. Please read if you are unsure of what abuse looks like and may be suspecting you are going through something similar; or just interested. Please excuse my multiple multiple use of brackets, its for a somewhat a humorous or legitimising effect.  The day I met... lets call him.. (Redacted) (He used to consider himself the music man so (Redacted)lol) he told me within an hour that I was so much more beautiful than he thought I would be (I am also a man btw). The way he said it, the way I felt it, I thought it was surreal almost instantly (big foreshadowing). That night we talked, sang, danced. We also had sex, during which he told me he loved me and I regrettably reciprocated.  The first few weeks were nothing short of utopic. We got so tight so fast, we did EVERYTHING together I told all my friends and family about him, changed my Facebook profile picture to the both of us, allowed him into my life with 0 resistance.  The original red flag (the thing that sticks out in my head so much now I recount it) happened so FUCKING subtly and gently. One morning I left as usual to go to university. I was in my second year and the weather was dreadful. A tree had fallen on to the platform, as a result, the Train couldn't go to my University. I went home, childishly excited to play some video games rather than go to a lecture; (Redacted) also went home, unable to make it to his college. As I walked through my front door, I got a phone call from him.  Abuser: ""Hey what you doing""  ""Nothing much (gleefully), gonna play some games chill out""   Abuser: ""Oh.. I thought you were going to come to mine?""  ""Oh..""  ""Do you want me to?""  Abuser: ""No I mean not if you don't want to""  ""I mean I will if you want? (Not wanting to ruin this brand new amazing relationship)  Abuser: ""No no its okay whatever.""  ""Ok? I mean I can come tomorrow or the day after""  Abuser: ""No sorry I'm busy""  (Redacted) Didn't work or have immediate friends or family... he was not busy)  \-At this point in time, the implication that I had to go down to his had dawned on me, I said to myself if I don't go, our relationship will either be tarnished or ruined, I thought he WANTS me there, he cares about me, I'm being selfish-  I then went to his house. To give a little more context - I smoke a lot of weed (especially at that time) and I don't know if it was the weed or my subconscious trying to warn me, but when I got there and looked at him he looked like a literal rat. His long nose, his skinny body. It was weird. Anyways, when I got there I saw this whole different side to him. He was obsessed with music and his shitty music website. To conclude the initial red flag I basically sacrificed my day for his.  Fast forward a couple of months, I had completely submitted to his weekly organisation. What I mean by that was, if (Redacted) had somewhere to be on a Tuesday at 6 pm, so did I. I gave in to him because, the emotional and physical passion between us was so meticulously manipulated by him I lost myself.  Then the drinking really started to take over our relationship. My priorities had switched from my present to his future. He would drink a lot, as a result so did I, because I had to do what he did. We would drink to early morning hours maybe 2 to 4 days a week. He honestly had went through so much with his family issues just to list for anyone still reading for more context (He was shunned for being gay, kicked out, bullied, he also had somewhat of a locally viral video of him having a meltdown posted everywhere on social media). So I kinda get why he enjoyed to drink so much.  We started going to Gay clubs, and ""normal clubs"" and every time we went together it was a disaster. He would get jealous easily and try to maintain my attention the whole time. The thing is, is that I'm a naturally inquisitive person, I don't go to a club to get super fucked up. I go to speak to the middle aged women in the smoking area, to learn about them and talk to people. I wonder off. However, it is so difficult to live that experience when you have (Redacted)up your ass the whole time. He didn't have friends to sit with so I understand why he would follow me but, he took those experiences from me and never allowed me to build bridges with others. Red flag number 2.  Nightclubs and the joy never lasted long. Covid 19 emerged. This is when things got so much worse. On a regular basis, (Redacted)would drink so much for so long. This resulted in him getting physically rather than emotionally abusive. He would wake me up in my sleep to argue about the most irrelevant thing like alcoholics do. When I tried to explain, ""if you're going to be like this then I'll just go home tonight"" he would become EXTREMELY aggressive, push me punch me grab my neck ripping my shirt or jumper. When that didn't work (I would still be extremely calm to this point, only creating distance through force when necessary. which was easy to do because I was a lot stronger) he would call the police.  I live a small part of Europe When the police are called to a domestic abuse report (even if it was by the abuser which cant be proved unless evident, (luckily I would put my phone on record a lot when I went to bed in case he did get abusive) the police have to arrest both people. I was arrested on false premises more times than I can count. I spent multiple nights in custody and countless interviews explaining how I wasn't culpable, even though every time the police would come (Redacted)would be extremely intoxicated.  Anyways, after I got out of jail one morning (never convicted once by the way, obviously) I went back to our shared apartment (Yes after red flag one and red flag too I still moved in, of course I was na_¯ve and manipulated, gaslighted and lovebombed at the time.) When I returned to the apartment I literally got down on my hands and knees and cleaned his dogs shit off our carpet. Fixed the living room and made us dinner. I still think about that till this day, I really let that mother fucker get so under my skin I became his fucking maid.  Fast forward slightly, I'm now in my final year of university. The abuse was daily, he still drank to excess. I am over-encumbered enormously with university work. My dissertation is coming up and the abuse had multiplied. When I think back on it I think he was either jealous or afraid I was moving on. I broke up with him multiple times, even moved out, but fell for the same old tricks and moved back in before my final year of university to the embarrassment of myself my dad and my twin brother who all despised him.  However, one night, I was probably playing his PlayStation or on my computer he started the abuse cycle for that night. I couldn't take it. WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME ANYMORE? I went home.  The next day, I found out he had went to his female friends house, this girl was more of a enemy to him. You know one of those people that treats the person you know like shit? but they still seem to like that person anyway? well that was (Redacted)and his friend.  He took hard drugs. I don't know if it was cocaine or ecstasy or ketamine. Maybe a mix. But he made his way to my house still intoxicated the next morning and kicked the door for what felt like forever. I panicked not knowing what was going on, when I opened the door he put his hands round my throat and forced me to the ground. In that moment I was fucking terrified but my instincts kicked in, and I easily overpowered him to create distance. ((Redacted)had a knife offence, I was terrified he was going to stab me) I some how managed to get him out the door and locked it and called the police.  The kicker? I went back to him the very next day and APOLOGISED.  The ending of my abuse story happened shortly after, I couldn't touch him sexually couldn't connect emotionally. As abusers always do and always will, he picked up on it. Interrogated me, felt abandoned by me gave me his usual guilt trip. A week before my final dissertation (10 thousand words) was due, He tried to repeat his cycle of abuse. I again couldn't handle it, but this time even more so considering I was near graduation.  I left for my twin brothers, to ashamed to ask my dad to move back in. I explained to them what was going on (At this time I think (Redacted)had started to realise what he was doing to me, he started to say things like ""You deserve so much better etc..."") I said to my brother and his long term girlfriend ""He doesn't love me anymore, I feel awful blah blah.."" They told me: ""You haven't been yourself in a while, he is abusing you"" (In a nutshell) they made me realised what I was going through. Even to this day though, I still look out my window worrying he may be walking up the street.  I never went back. I got my degree (Top of the class too ;) ). I survived."

emotional,How to deal with an abuser who's improving but still falls back on some hurtful behaviors?,"Hi, this is my first reddit post, and I'm really not active online much at all so apologies in advance if my formatting or anything is weird.  So I'm 19 and I've come to the private conclusion that my parents were emotionally abusive to me growing up. I was often yelled at for doing the exact same things or getting the exact same grades my sisters would because ""I should know/be better"" than them, and called stupid and lazy and selfish because I had a hard time managing schedules or couldn't make eye contact when I was told to. I was also the one they unloaded all their emotional baggage onto because I'm the oldest and would ""understand them better"". I had a front seat to the way that their relationship took a downward spiral over the past 10 years and basically was their live-in councilor during the year and a half leading up to their divorce. I got severely depressed in middle school because I became utterly convinced that my mom wished I had never been born and that she secretly hated me because she told me multiple times having kids when she did was one of the biggest mistakes of her life, even if she did love me.  But the thing is, on some level I get why they behaved the way they did. They were young when they got married and had me and have admitted to having a lot of undiagnosed trauma and mental health issues that they were both dealing with over the course of my childhood on top of marital and religious issues. I don't think it excuses their behavior but I understand why they behaved in the way they did and don't think they were trying to be cruel or intentionally harmful. And they've apologized for how they handled a lot of how they treated (even if it was mostly a ""sorry i was depressed and acted this way"" rather than a ""sorry i hurt you"" apology but that stuff can be really hard to accept and the therapy thing is pretty new for both of them so I get it) so I feel kinda bad for still feeling a bit off with my relationships with the both of them.  They're both dating new people and reinventing themselves and I've moved to a nearby apartment so there's some distance and things are on the whole a lot better. They both completely dropped all pretenses of trying to monitor or keep tabs on me when I became an adult and now it feels like I've got these two adult friends who I hang out with and I share finances with, but sometimes its feels the same as when I lived with them? They both still dump their unresolved feelings about their previous marriage on me and just recently my mom got really upset at me that I was taking the bus to and from work instead of driving because she thinks driving is safer, and gave me the silent treatment for a few days because she didn't think I was trying hard enough to get an appointment for a drivers test (they're really hard to get right now in my state). I feel like I cant talk to them about my own difficulties this past year either without them saying Im being a bit dramatic (despite the fact I've told them I've been genuinely suicidal at points)  I feel bad harping on these issues though because they've improved so much and they're genuinely really great parents to my youngest sister who's still living with them. They're emotionally stable and available, they don't yell, they have reasonable boundaries and their punishments aren't insane and the feeling of always being on edge is completely gone. They've come a long way and I hate to diminish that progress just because they still vent to me and get disappointed when they see me seemingly mess up important tasks, but I still feel like they get a lot more emotional support from me than I do from them and I don't feel comfortable going to them for anything other than ""friendly hangout time with friends"". But that's also an improvement because we didn't really do that before? Things are so good compared to how it used to be and they're getting better about the things that matter all the time. I feel like Im just being ungrateful wanting them to just. Be what I want them to be when they've already done so much. Is there a way to celebrate improvement while still wanting them to be better, or is that asking too much of a person healing from their own trauma?  TL;DR: I don't feel like my parents are bad people despite their behavior because I know they're trying, but how do I deal with the fact that trying still leaves me in an emotionally unbalanced situation?"
emotional,Advice?,"hi. i don__ know if i can ask questions here but I am 16, female, i live in tennessee, i am here asking for advice on what me and my family can do, i have three younger siblings, all under the age of 14, my father is emotionally abusive towards all of us, he has been emotionally abusing my mother for years and i have witnessed it all growing up but the abuse towards my siblings has only recently started, my father yells, hits things, belittle and degrades me (including my mother and my other siblings) he also has tried to kick me out whenever i stood up for myself, my main question is what can we do if he tries to get custody? my mom is currently planning on divorcing him and my father knows this, he has threatened to get me and my siblings taken from her cause we are not enrolled in school and never have been, He is the reason because he will not pay for it and he doesn__ agree with school, He only lets us be homeschooled, my mother has followed along with this and she has tried to homeschool us but due to the abuse she has endured she has not been able to keep up with schooling, we are all extremely behind. He is now saying he wants us in school and he is gonna get custody of us and blame her, she drinks quite a lot but is never drunk and he is also gonna use that against her, if he accuses her of educational neglect will she go to jail? i am so scared of him getting custody, he scares me and my siblings and we are afraid everyday, we can__ even sleep cause he is always yelling at our mom and we fear for her safety, the house we live in is under his name and my mom has absolutely no money, she is a stay at home mom and has been for 14 years, what can we do? Do laws take emotional abuse serious?  also side note, i have some video proof of him yelling and belittling me and my mom, can i use that for legal action? my mom also has texts, there__ so much more to the story so feel free to ask questions. She is a great mother and takes care of us to the best of her abilities and i will do anything to make sure she gets away from him, she wants to divorce him so bad but we are all scared."
physical,Long term abuse injuries,"Hi. I thought I would ask this here since I don't talk to anyone about my abuse and have never gone to the hospital. I've been abused for about 4 or 5 years now pretty severely. I've been slammed around on the ground, slapped extremely hard, kicked etc. What has concerned me most are the head injuries. I've been choked a lot, twice I've lost consciousness and come close many other times. He once punched me in the head so hard it looked like a battle signs injury (never got it looked at). Im pretty sure the cartilage in my left ear is damaged from that same hit. There's a lot of other blows I've taken I can't remember the details of. I also have basically hemotomas I guess on my leg that are just massive lumps from bruises he inflicted literally years ago. Will these go away? Is my brain fucked up forever? I'm just really scared for my future health"

emotional,bitter about reunion with an emotional manipulative &amp; abusive ex,"hi. i was in a very very emotionally abusive relationship in my freshman year of high school. it lasted about 8 months and after that i attempted suicide and changed schools. for some reason, i still missed this person. even though they ruined my high school experience but playing the victim after we broke things off, i *still* missed them. so i found them again and tried to have some sort of closure because even now, six years later, i am in pain and i miss them and i blame myself.   anyway i tried to get some closure and they just....made it about them. they said they __idn__ remember_ half of the traumatic situations they put me through and tried to blame it on their mental health state at the time. don__ get me wrong, i have mental disorders, too, but i didn__ abuse anyone and i__ not going to use that to say it doesnt count.   anyway this is mostly just a vent but i would love it if someone could give me some insight or possibly some tips on how to heal from this. i want to go into therapy but i am afraid of being ridiculed for my experiences. idk :/"
physical,Support,"Hi. So I don__ think there is any easy way to say this but I__ going to come out and say it. I lost my mom to domestic violence when I was 16. I witnessed it and now my father, if you can even call him that, is in prison. I__ 21F, not sure if I__e ever recovered or if I ever will. I was hoping someone, anyone, could offer some support or share their stories of what they have done to cope if something similar has happened to you. How do you find love? How do you handle, maintain, or stop relationships with the side of your family that the abuser was on? How do you not blame yourself? How do you go on to lead a happy and healthy life while still honoring those you lost? How do you handle a new life after everything you once knew was flipped upside down and stolen from underneath you?"
emotional,things my mom did,"Hi. This is my first post. I am 19, I recently moved out of my mom's house and am staying long term with my friend and his parents.

For context, I am an only child and lived primarily with my mom for my entire life.        - She claimed i had been manipulating her since i was 5 years old because ""You would cry and tell me you didn't understand why I was angry with you when you clearly knew what you did wrong because you were obviously smart and it was so obvious so I didn't understand how you could be so smart and not get it so I figured you were lying to me""          - When i was a kid she used to yell at me for like an hour and I had to apologize over and over even though i usually didn't understand why she was yelling at me/why she was being so mean, then she'd come in my room like four hours later and dramatically say ""im sORRY FoR YeLLiNG"" then break down and start calling herself a horrible mother and I'd have to comfort her        - When I was 12 I told her I was scared of her after she screamed at me and she told me to never tell anyone that I was scared of her ever because that's what people say when their parents are physically abusing them and she wasn't abusing me so clearly, I didn't really mean I was ""scared""     - She sold our house in like July to buy a new house with her boyfriend and was like ""sorry if you're uncomfortable with this but im doing whats best for my mental health and I want to spend the rest of my life with him and the housing market is really good right now and you don't pay the mortgage so you don't have a say in where we're going""          - I told her I was feeling suicidal and she screamed at me that I was inconveniencing her if she had to take me to the hospital, that I apparently have it easier than anyone else my age because I am not in school or working and that she knows 5 other autistic people that are all helping themselves and she doesn't understand why I'm not helping myself to get better         - She said that ""enough is enough"" and she ""doesn't want this next stage of her life to be all about me anymore"" as she was looking into group homes for me to live in        - She moved her previous boyfriend into our house for 6 months when i was 16 without even talking to me about it because ""he didn't have anywhere else to go"" and when I tried to tell her i was uncomfortable with him living with us she screamed ""well what do you want me to do, break up with him??? He needed a place to stay and I wasn't going to say no""         - I said i was worried and uncomfortable about her boyfriend coming over back in march at the beginning of corona and she screamed at me for trying to control her life and be her parent instead of her child and then the next day told me I had done a really great job driving a wedge between her and her boyfriend when that wasn't what I was trying to do at all       - I'm severely allergic to peanuts and her boyfriend brought in a big jar of peanuts and I said I was uncomfortable having it in the house and she was like ""oh no its fine he'll keep it in the basement"" and I was like.. that doesn't help if he eats from the jar and then touches the doorknob i can have a reaction from touching the doorknob and i got yelled at for overreacting when it was literally a safety issue        - She told me I talked too much about my anxiety and talked too much in general and that it was making her anxious so i needed to stop (I have GAD, social anxiety and PTSD)          - When I first told her I thought I might be autistic she laughed in my face and then said I only thought that because I was trying to be more like my friend        - When I was being hospitalized for the first time for suicidal ideation she asked me THREE TIMES if I was doing it for attention        - Said i was financially manipulating her by not having a job and asking her for things I needed or wanted past the age of 18 while living with her        - Also ""I figured you probably had ADHD as a kid but I never got you tested because you were so smart and doing well in elementary school""     - She said I was a hypochondriac and that I was perfectly fine. I lived with undiagnosed ADHD, Autism, IBS, hypermobility, depression, anxiety, social anxiety and ptsd for the majority of my life.     - She would never give me her full attention. She was always on her phone while I was talking to her. And if I got upset that I was showing her something and she wasn't paying attention, she'd gripe about how I was trying to control her, she WAS paying attention, I was being ridiculous, I couldn't expect her to pay attention to everything I said because I talked way too much, etc."
emotional,Feeling guilt about being in a safe space,"Hiya friends,  I've suffered from emotional abuse for years for my parents but Ive recently had to flee to a refuge as the abuse became physical.  I feel safe here and I can relax but I feel guilty about it, like I should still be suffering somehow.  Does anyone have advice on dealing with this? It's such a strange feeling and I know I don't have anything to be guilty about."
emotional,How do you not let the abuse get to you?,"Honestly I just feel so low. It__ taken me some time but realizing that my husbands tactics are emotionally abusive has given me power. Unfortunately, I still fall victim and find myself upset and crying all the time over everything. Yesterday we were supposed to hang out (we are separated) and we got into an argument so I was waiting for him to tell me to come over and he said __hhh no our fighting made me realize we aren__ ready to start hanging out. I thought that was obvious to you._ So he had me like waiting around all day but never tells me that he__ decided to change plans and not invite me over. Then he said __ell you shouldn__ have argued and brought up Heather (the girl he slept with during our separation) multiple times_. So it became my fault that we aren__ hanging out and I get blamed for it. I was so depressed I went to bed. The way he talks to me and makes me feel is just so low. I honestly don__ even wanna get out of bed most of the time. I wish I had the strength to block him but I want to be together..."
physical,IT GETS BETTER,"Honestly there__ nothing good about being in a DV situation. And I think the hardest thing to realize was that all the hope, love, caring, and expectation I put into the relationship was not reciprocated at all. Turns out, this man really didn__ love me, really had no interest in supporting me or even treating me like a human. He gave a million excuses and explanations for the abuse, but the real answer is that he__ an uncaring asshole who I should not have been with.  BUT, since that was true, it__ also true that my life has gotten A MILLION TIMES BETTER after kicking him out. TURNS OUT, despite everything you__e ever said and done to put me down, it__ *you* who isn__ good enough to be in *my* life. Some of it is for obvious reasons (like it__ easier to be good at my job when I__ not being constantly hurt and screamed at) but it__ also that I__e been able to put the right people and things in my life. My self confidence, productivity, vibes, everything is off the charts better. And looking back it__ p obvious why.  If there__ anyone out there who is scared to break up with your abusive partner, please believe me that YOU WILL GET BETTER much faster, without that piece of trash in your life, messing up your mood and getting in your way. You deserve peace and freedom. And you will appreciate it 1000x .   _¤ï__¤ï__¤ï_"

physical,Struggling to get my head around it,"Honestly, that's it. I'm really struggling to get around the level of abuse that's been happening. I'm getting some help next week, but I'm scared. I'm literally terrified, can't sleep, don't want to eat over it. It's been mostly emotional, verbal, mental. And now I'm realising likely some sexual and physical too, and I feel stupid and scared."
physical,Regret,how do u even begin to stop mourning what could've been and what you could've had if you'd have done things differently and left earlier
emotional,Tips for coping with the emotional rollercoaster?,"How do you cope with the walking on eggshells and emotional rollercoaster? One day, everything is good. The next, I am verbally attacked and emotionally dismissed. It's not helping that I barely get any time to myself for myself. That is greatly limiting my ability to even basically self-care. Any advice to help get through this?"
physical,Rock and a hard place.,How does someone get help once their mental health has broken down so much that if it__ documented somewhere the abusive baby daddy would absolutely use it against to take the kids away and that__ their ultimate goal so it would be like handing them over to him on a gold platter... like damned if you get help damned if you don__.
emotional,Was this abuse? Did I do anything wrong?,"I (18F) had this online friend (17F) for around a month. She was clearly obsessed with me and made me responsible for taking care of her emotions, all of the time and I'm not exaggerating would be me comforting them. There would be very little if any breaks. I'm surprised I lasted so long before it started effecting my mental health. I told her how it would effect me, I said sorry for shutting down mentally when they'd do that and giving pretty one note replies because I felt like I was the bad guy for not doing a good enough job. I told her that I wanted to help but it would be pretty overwhelming for me, her didn't change that behaviour. Even with other boundaries I tried to set up like to tone down the compliments they'd give for damage control because it made me uncomfortable. That also never really stopped. She must've known it would have some effect on me right? I remember the week before school was going to start for her she kept going on for hours about how they were planning on offing themselves on the first day, I couldn't do anything since this was all online, I don't know where she__ located. She ended up moving to online school, then sulked about that because they wanted to go in person and have fun meeting everyone. I don't understand that. I hate to make this assumption but it seems all very preformative doesn't it? I ended up just blocking/ghosting her and giving an explanation when she contacted me somewhere else, I said I may be able to talk again but I need space. A week after that she said how they knew we wouldn't get in contact again and how if we did it would just be us hurting each other. That also seemed weird to me, in that time I have some proof that they may of made a new friend. I fucked up too I think, I vented a few times with permission, I'd mention my self harm urges but make it clear that I wasn't in any sort of danger nor would I put myself in any danger. I regret saying anything but with the amount of venting she was doing I assumed she__ be ok with me talking about my own issues. I can't get over feeling like I'm the problem and feeling guilty for cutting ties. I want to be able to move on, I'm tired of thinking about this constantly"
emotional,Something I saw just really triggered a reaction from me. I keep experiencing these reactions on a daily basis. Does it get better?,"I (20f) got out of an emotionally abusive relationship three months ago. He (24m) and I lived together. Just last night, I finally told my family everything that really went on in that relationship. All of the things he really did to me. It all came out last night because I dreamt about him. The dream was so vivid and so realistic that it was like I was back there. He had me in a corner and he was shouting at me, calling me a bitch and embarrassment to him. Just like he used to.  What happened in the dream was just one of many examples of things he used to do and say. I was TERRIFIED of him. He used to shout at me and call me crazy for being scared of him too.   So, I was scrolling through TikTok just now and a video came up of a woman providing an example of emotional abuse. It was an audio recording of her ex husband screaming at her. In the audio, he says __UCKING DIVORCE ME THEN_. My ex used to say the exact same thing. __UCKING LEAVE ME THEN. WHY YOU STILL HERE IF I__ THAT BAD?_. (Then, on the occasions when I said I was leaving he cried and begged me to stay). This video really set me off. I instantly threw my phone and burst into tears. So many things keep setting me off recently.   I woke up with a hangover the other morning and spent the whole day with a racing heart in a state of panic because in the back of my mind I was thinking __hat if you__e done something to embarrass him. He__l be so angry_.   I__ jumpy all of the time. A car drove past me yesterday and I jumped out of my skin. It wasn__ even anywhere near me. If my mum calls my name it makes me jump!   Does it get better? Please tell me it gets better."
emotional,I don__ know how to get financially independent,"I (22nb) live with my emotionally abusive mom. She never taught my basic life skills, and has basically made it impossible for me to leave (while also ridiculing me for being dependent on her).  I had a couple jobs in community college, so I have some savings, but I don__ see how I__l be able to get an __dult_ job. I only got my college jobs because I knew people/no one else applied. I__ extremely socially awkward (undiagnosed autism), I__ never make i through an actual interview, and couldn__ do any customer facing jobs. I__e been unemployed for a year at this point, and don__ really have __onnections_ anymore. I make a little bit from random online stuff, but not even close to what I__ need to be independent.  I also have only a couple friends, none of whom I__ be able to live with or could  even just help me move out if I could.  Sorry if this was awkward and all over the place, she yelled at me a bit ago and I__e just been really struggling/overwhelmed tonight. I feel like I have no one to support me or root for me on life."
physical,My parents act completely normal with other people and I feel ungrateful.,"I (23F) still live with my parents (53M, 45F). I wish I had the opportunity to leave the house way before, but I couldn't live alone since I had seizures on a daily basis. Now I feel better and with a change of medication I have gone from several seizures a day to absolutely no seizures.  My parents are extremely traditional. Traditional, overprotective and maybe... abusive? I still feel guilty calling them abusive. Why? They are extremely protective and worried about my health. When I was at the hospital they were very caring. Nurses and doctors told me ""You have a very supportive and loving family, unlike most people we see on a regular basis unfortunately"".  When I was ill, my mother would come everyday even at night (even when she was not on holidays), and all I could do at the time was complaining about my health issue and crying a lot. My dad would bring me nice food almost everyday because the hospital food was not so great as you would expect. Even friends and extended family find my parents ""overprotective"" but adorable and extremely loving.  **However, I still don't understand most of their behavior :**  \- When I was younger my parents would argue everyday at night, I would hear them throwing dishes against the wall, yelling in another room, slamming doors... I was confused and scared. I was also scared for my mother, I thought that my dad would be able to kill my mother if he wanted to. Once my dad went absolutely furious because of my mother's ""manipulative and disrespectful behavior"" and he made violent threats. It was terrible for my siblings and we had to leave the house with my mother for a few hours, just in case.  I have tried several times to talk about these events to my mother years later and she told me ""he's just furious at the moment but two hours later he forgets about it"". That's true. And to be fair he is not always like that. Most of the time he's just very kind and funny. But he completely has anger issues with me and my mother. My other siblings do everything to please him so he never really has any issues with them, I was always the ""rebel"" one according to both of my parents because I have some insight about their behavior and yes I do have a ... controversial temperament, I am the only one among my siblings. Otherwise every single person I have met see me as extremely polite and not an argumentative person.  But... yesterday, many years later... he did exactly the same thing with me. I was wearing a beanie in hot weather because I didn't have time to blow dry my hair properly. I know that it's not the right time to wear a beanie but I don't think I caused him prejudice by wearing my beanie. He went completely furious, yelled in front of me and said ""Now just SHUT UP or I am going to humiliate you in front of everyone in the street and in public places"", which he almost did in front of someone before I left and cry.  I told my mother about what happened, she said I was ""oversensitive"", and that this event was ""created by my own imagination"", ""you know I have always known that you were extremely creative, even as a child"", (I must admit that I was extremely sensitive as a child but I would never lie or make false statements about events which truly happened and I don't have any history of pathological lying). Once she even said that I was ""oversensitive"" and ""giving to much importance to bad people"" when I tried to confess about things that happened to me in school, such as extreme bullying including repeated rape threats.  **Another event :**  I cannot date anyone besides the context of marriage, so when my parents learnt that I was dating someone (I was 17) and lied for the first time about seeing a female friend instead of my boyfriend they also went furious, started to beat me, bite me, pulled my hair. It was **extremely violent**. They called me names ""slut"", ""shame to the family"", ""in our family dating without marriage is FORBIDDEN every woman here knows that, you're the only one, you don't respect your own father"" They also locked me in a room, took my mobile phone and more, I couldn't even call the cops. But several years later this even was completely forgotten. I believe that the reason why they stopped being so mean with me is that they knew I would speak against them to other family members. And I have decided to forgive them for that event. I was too kind. The beanie event was way too much.  &amp;#x200B;  **Other events**  \- Trying to make me feel like a ""spoiled child"" for having food and water. I had to take extremely cold showers for years because my parents just didn't care at all about it. The only time I was ""spoiled"" (I wasn't *really* spoiled but they cared about me) was after being in the emergency room at the hospital, so it was way later.  But despite that I still think my parents worked hard for me for me and my siblings.  \- My mother was calling me names as a child  \- When my grades were not good enough, I was beaten and yelled at, **because most of the time** I had excellent grades, **except when I was ill and bullied**  \- Cannot leave the house alone or even with friends in the evening and at night, my father has to be there to drive me at the place. ""For my own safety"", ""to avoid getting raped or murdered"".  **What I want to do now**  Leave in a few months ""for my studies"" officially, because I am done living with them exactly. I might have an apartment after summer. I am not even doing therapy for two reasons.  I have a bad experience with a therapist who couldn't admit that the issue was more than ""overprotective parenting"" and I want to save money for the next few months. If they won't let me leave (I don't want to have the police involved) I will have to go on my own without them noticing the day I leave, just with a backpack. Since I won't have anyone in my family to help me with the apartment moving stuff, I am probably going to leave a lot of belongings in my parents' house. Since I might cut contact with them if things don't turn well it will probably be lost. But my safety and well-being are more important and I realize I have been in denial my whole life.  But now I feel completely lost. My entire life has been a lie : my ""parents"" are not the ""kind"" people I thought they were and I don't feel safe anymore. I want to stop confessing stuff to my mother because she makes me feel like a complete ungrateful liar, which I am not. And when I talk to other people about my parents, either they think I am overreacting because ""it's obvious that they love me despite all the bad stuff"", either they believe me but think I just have to ""disobey"", ""you're an adult after all"". Yes, an adult, but terrified of my own parents and their reactions.  Tl;dr: I feel completely ungrateful for calling my parents ""abusive"" (when they can actually be violent, for innocent things like dating or wearing a beanie in hot weather, which can be seen as a lack of respect in my parents' eyes), because they make me feel like a spoiled person for having access to decent housing and food. I want to leave them soon but my entire life has been a joke and I am devastated"
physical,Second guessing myself,"I (25f) came to terms about 1.5 to 2 years ago that my husband (30m) is emotionally abusive. I feel like the fights and stuff have simmered down since moving halfway across the country, but they still occur a couple times a month. I'm currently back in my home state for work for a month, and when I talk to him, he seems like a loving husband. Is he possibly changing now?   We are about to move to his home state (different than mine). He seems excited about it and is ready to have a different job and says his job is a big reason why he is so depressed, stressed, and anxious. As I'm reading more about abuse, I can relate to a lot, but is he now maybe not abusive?"
emotional,Is it normal to feel like I made a mistake leaving my abusive ex?,"I (f/30) left my emotionally abusive boyfriend (32/m) of almost three years a few days ago and I feel like crap. I had enough of his gaslighting and manipulative behavior towards me. I know I deserve better, but part of me feels like I should've stayed and worked things out.  The day of the breakup he had sat me down and finally apologized for all his wrongs. From him blaming me for his reasonings of ""emotional"" cheating, to how he was accusing me of cheating even though he knew I wasn't, to being controlling. He said he loved me so much and wanted to be with me but didn't want to hurt me anymore. He admitted he was at fault for making me depressed and insecure and didn't want to continue his behavior. I felt like he wanted to end it but he also never said he wanted to work it out when I asked if he wanted to. He wanted time to think but after all he has put me through, I ended it. I've given him so many chances to change, I didn't want to wait.   Right now my head tells me I should've gave him another chance because he was actually trying. I feel guilty. I feel like I deserved to be treated the way I was treated. I know it's all wrong but I think my mind keeps convincing myself that I wasn't emotionally abused.  Is this normal? How can I make these thoughts stop? I have a therapist by the way but I see her next Tuesday and I can't wait that long plus I feel embarrassed to even state that I stayed after so long of knowing I was in a toxic relationship. I don't know why I try to justify his actions."
emotional,Finally making plans to leave,"I (F20) have been living with my partner for a year, I didn__ even realise I was being abused until recently.   I have been stripped bare of my dignity until now, he would force me to take off my clothes and inspect them after work to make sure I wasn__ cheating on him, he yells, forces sex upon me, he speaks to me like I am a child, he tells what I can and can__ wear, who I can and can__ speak to.   I__e had enough, I__e set my __-Day_ for two months away, I__ desperately trying to save as much money as I can, as I don__ have contact with my family anymore (thanks to him) for any help or support.   How do you cope with the depression and the hurt in the meantime? He knows something is up and I__ so stressed and scared that he__ going to figure out what__ going on and hurt me. I can barely look at him without feeling sick, I don__ want to be in the same room as him.   I__ scared and I__ lost, but I__ slowly building my self esteem back up. I know I can do this but I__ simultaneously petrified.   I know my future can be brighter than this and that I deserve basic respect and autonomy. Everything will be okay soon. I think.  If anyone has any advice to offer or just any words of encouragement I__ appreciate it, I__ terrified."
emotional,Trying to leave alcoholic after he called me a stupid bitch and grabbed my face.,"I [25F] have been dating my bf [27M] for 2.5 years. He is an alcoholic and though he has tried to quit many times, we always wind up in fights with him drunk. Like most abusive relationships, it started off innocent then escalated. He used to be very kind to me. Now it is like any thing at all can result in me getting yelled at. He was drunk and wanted me to sing with him, I didn't because I wanted to sleep (midnight, I am full time employed at a high stress job and do grad school after work). He yelled about how I'm an absolute killjoy, suck the fun out of the room, and if this is how I am no wonder my last relationships didn't work out.  All because I didn't sing with him.  Last night we got in a fight (granted I was in a bad mood and probably didn't help the situation) and he called me a stupid fucking bitch. He grabbed my face because he wanted me to be quiet. I yelled at him for grabbing my jaw but he still insists he just ""was covering my mouth because I was being loud"". Even if that is the truth, touching me while argue is a huge problem for me. The next morning he doubled down that I shouldn't have been yelling that he grabbed me and called me a bitch, and I should stop playing the victim. I put it bluntly- I won't yell about you grabbing me if you don't grab me. Simple.   There are good times, and they will be good for a while and I will start to see who he used to be/could be. Then something like this happens.    5 weeks ago he threatened to sell my engagement ring (hasnt proposed yet but he bought one). I was sitting in the other room crying and he told me ""get your fucking ass in here"" and I told him to take back his comments or it is over, and he told me to shut the fuck up. This is the first time the verbal abuse started.  I have no clue why I tolerate this. After his comments 5 weeks ago he was very apologetic (as always) and assured me he was giving up alcohol and this would never happen again.  I stayed with him while he went through detox shakes and cold sweats. Yet flash forward 5 weeks, last night still happened. I feel like an anxious wreck and I'm worried I won't be able to stay away from him. This is my first real breakup and I have gone back so many times despite how unsafe it is. He has driven drunk with me in the car dangerously, and now the verbal abuse is very real. It feels like it is escalating.  It is so strange to write everything out because if I read it from someone else's perspective, I would be so worried for them. I've been thinking ""how would I feel if someone said/did this to my neice"" and absolutely not tolerable. I'm someone's niece too. And someone's daughter. I am loved anyone who I have been hiding this from would want much better for me. I don't know what I want from this post I just need to get all of my feelings out. Thank you for reading."
physical,Feels like DV took my future away.,"I \[F21\] separated from my abuser \[F23\] in March and was able to go full no contact recently, which I thought would make me feel proud. Instead, I feel even more lost. I'm in therapy, on medication, trying to use all the self-care techniques I can think of to heal, but a part of me just feels lost forever. Before the relationship, I was doing well at university, maintained a stable job, and had some good people to lean on. I came from a poor family and always wanted to go to uni and even had thoughts of grad school. Now, because of the mental/emotional toll of abuse, I'm on the verge of dropping out, I had to leave my steady job, and I am housing insecure. I am so stuck in depression and fear that I can't see a future for myself anymore. I am also struggling to manage the self-hatred that comes with ""getting myself into this situation"" as that toxic part of my mind likes to put it.   How did you start seeing a future for yourself again? How do you make peace with the fact that the person you were before is gone forever, without blaming yourself for who you are now?"
emotional,My wife took few minutes break when I called out on her lying,I 31M and my wife 32F are married for 5 years. Our relationship is on the breaking point and I have taken it to MC. It is for sure my wife has been abusive over past 5 years. I have observed of-lately that she lies in discussions (not sure if that has been the case always).   So in a discussion she started telling a lie (that she said a particular thing) supporting her action. I called her out and confidently said that you never said that. She was like __k why don__ you tell me what I said as you seem to know better_. I told her word by word what she said (thanks that I have been making notes of our short discussions). She tried to fight it but I stood firm. Her facial expression changed completely and she asked for 15 minutes to think and then talk. 15 minutes later she justified her lying by saying those were her thoughts and she did not remember what portion of her thoughts she said to me and did not say.   Did any of your abusive spouse did that? Should I believe her or is she making an excuse to get out of conscious lying.
physical,How can someone be so horrible???,"I am 26 years old. I have a preemie son who just got out the NICU after 122 days of being there. He was born at 27 weeks gestation weighing 1 pound 5oz. I falso have two toddlers 2 &amp; 3 years old. I ended up having my son at 27 weeks because my husband, and my children's father, got mad and lost his temper and grabbed me and body slammed me off our drive porch on our house onto the ground. He repeatedly kicked me from my head, belly, and legs. Hard enough to break 3 ribs, my collar bone, jaw, and almost killed my unborn baby. I blacked out from the pain and woke up  8 days later in a hospital ICU with tubes and casts all over. I was informed they had to go in and take my son during a emergency csection because husband had ruptured the placenta and my baby's heart rate was super low. Anyway my son is a miracle for making it and so am I. I could have died and so could my baby. I am not going to keep rambling and making a super long post. I just wanted you guys to know a back story. My husband told me that day he hurt me that if I ever called the cops again on him that he would KILL me. I didn't call the cops our neighbor did because she seen it all Happen and she thought I was dead.

physical,"My Dad Pinched Deeply with nails , deeps marks still left on skin","I am a 17 year old , my childhood was horrible. My father used to punish me for very small things. He would engrave his hard nails in my skin for few seconds, which was enough to make the skin area, and later spots of blood appeared. My mom used to cry while applying antiseptic on the spot.  He had really bad temper. And had tormented many women in our family, from aunts to my mom. But all kept their silence. From the time I was 13 till now, he is always saying he will kick me out the day I turn 18. I am from India. I have looked for many jobs online but haven't gotten any. Idk how I will support myself."
emotional,"Worst off than i thought, so much its preventing me from a last ditch effort to get some help with.","I am a man, I was abused emotionally and physically for 4 years( mostly emotional) by my ex girlfriend. I good looking, tiny little woman.  She isolated me, she controlled every move i made, and i had to always walk on egg shells, she was unfaithful and did not respect me.  I did everything i could to make it work.  I got hurt at work last year.  I had money saved up, she made me spend it all while she did what she wanted with her money. I didnt care. I needed her.  I also thought despite how mean she was, that when my funds ran out she would understand i would need a week  or 2 to get a paycheck if i didnt land a job i could do by then,  My funds ran out, she left me for another man.  I had no way of preparing for this.  Im going to be evicted from my home.  I reached out to every single personi knew.. i just needed help with this month.. and everyone turned a blind eye, nobody even bleived i was abused, got laughed at, told i was making a bigger deal than it was..   whats worst is over the years she would tell everyone i was bad to her, that i was controlling, and bad tempered!! i never aired our laundry like that, not even to my family...and even now shes doing that to  my mom! no one is taking me serious.. the county wont help nobody will help so i decided to make a go fund me...  so i passed it around via links to my family and friends.. and everyone left it on read.. i stated panicking so i found a place on the internet that allows you to post your links.. one of the requirements is you have to post a picture of yourself... and i can.. i just cant do it. during the time i was with my ex she would always put me down and call me fat and ugly and gross, and how she was so much better than me.. it got to the point where i stopped looking at myself in the mirror....and i cant bear  to look at photos of myself before i met her because i did use to be so decent looking... now i feel so...disgusted with myself.. she made me believe all the horrible things she said about me.. and its become true! over the past year since i got hurt i did gain a lot of weigh.. ive been depressed... and its more than self concious..i... idont know what it is.. but even to try to save my life i cant take a picture.. i know the chances of getting help for rent are slim to none, but i cant even bring myself to look at myself for the chance!!! im stuck i cant go anywhere.. i feel so ashamed of me.. i need help... i cant leave my house... im going to lose my home... my mind is screwed up,, and no, im not putting my gofund me out for donations, there is a huge community on the internet for that.  we are all here because life has done us dirty, and i could never take from people who have already had so much stolen... i promise so please nobody yell at me..i just.. my mind is messed up.. i went to sign up for mental services threw the county on wednesday.. they were supposed to call the next day.. ive  had my phone off since then.. im in a hole. and i have no one to be by myside.. i dont know....."
physical,Has anyone successfully helped someone in a domestic incident and been appreciated?,"I am asking this because I am now nursing a black eye and cut head. This is not a first either.   Context:   Last night I saw a man pin a women to the wall and slap her. I rushed over and told him to let her go. He swore at me and then slapped her again as she tried to look at me.   I'm not a big guy, but I did some MMA a few years back and I can handle myself OK. I put my feet into the back of knees to bring him down and then tried to restrain him with a choke hold.   Only for her to scream leave him alone and smash a bottle into the back of my head. The made me release the hold, he then turned around and hit me too.   \[This has been reported to the police before anyone asks\]  However, a few years ago, I also saw a women getting abused by a man, and when I asked him to leave her alone, she went off on one at me and started threatening me.  Before that, when I was about 16 I stepped into another incident only to get slapped by the women and hit by then man.  I don't feel I can just witness that kind of behaviour and do nothing, but I am also feeling what is the point in even trying to help."
physical,"Any success stories regarding finding a new, non-abusive partner after leaving Domestic Violence Situation?","I am dreaming about meeting a lifelong partner who will be loving and kind and OBVIOUSLY non- abusive and a nurturing step- parent to my son.

physical,Can anyone relate to my story?,"I am in the throes of mentally escaping a narcissistic ex, and could really use some support and encouragement. I'll begin by sharing a short rundown of what happened with hopes that you can relate. I was in a relationship with my NEX for five months, on the dot. We had a classic ""phonytale"" honeymoon phase, complete with intense limerence and his love-bombing. I was about to turn 28 when we met, and this was only my second relationship. I am a pretty mentally-strong person, or so I was before the relationship- but I did feel I had magically met my soulmate. So when he asked me to move in with him a month into the ship, I said yes. Not long after, I encountered the first red flag. We were sitting on the curb outside starbucks. A homeless man who was clearly mentally unstable stole NEX's pack of cigarettes. NEX reacted by violently kicking the shopping cart to the ground and causing a major scene. I was embarrassed and don't stand for that behavior, so I and a few strangers helped pick up the homeless man's stuff. NEX interpreted this as me betraying him, and we argued for a few days afterwards- mostly, me defending my response and reassuring him that I can be trusted/it wasn't betrayal/and I still love him. Meanwhile, he completely got away with his massively aggressive over-reaction. Nonetheless, our relationship persisted. Though crying has always been rare for me, I found myself crying often throughout our ship- always because of his gaslighting me. If I tried to show him how he is gaslighting or emotionally manipulating me, he reacted by questioning my sanity, or trying to convince me that I'm too stressed and sensitive, that I've changed since we met, or bringing up something from the past and twisting it to create a non-existent issue. Near the end of the ship, I fell in love with parrots and he was supportive. I decided to get a budgie, and he was supportive still. But almost immediately upon bringing my budgie home, he became jealous and displayed contempt..for the budgie, accusing me of spending too much time with the bird, and being more obsessed with it than I was with him. Fast forward to our fifth month anniversary. We went to the beach to celebrate, it was all love. We had never been drunk together, but on this day I felt like letting loose. At the bar, some strangers bought us shots of vodka. I sipped mine because I hate liquor. He tossed them back. I was tipsy-ish, and he was wasted. We went to the beach; there, police were called on us for public intoxication. I lied to them and said we were staying at a hotel nearby, and struggled to get NEX on his feet. Walking away, NEX started a fist fight with someone, and attempted to start more with others. He collapsed in a stretch of grass, was passing out and exposing himself to urinate shamelessly. He casually slapped me in the face. I couldn't move him, so I called his friends to come help me. When they arrived, NEX turned to me and lunged. Twice, he got his hands around my neck and his friends jumped in and pulled him off. We all got in the car. NEX reached up and grabbed my neck again, pinning it to the head rest before punching his friend and jumping from the moving car. His friends refused to help me go find him, and dropped me off on the side of the road. When I found NEX, he nailed me in the leg with his phone...really, painfully hard. After hours of walking around and arguing, I made the terrible decision to get in the car with him- mostly because I was afraid of him getting home before me and hurting my bird, or of accusing me of leaving with someone else and then trying to hurt me again. I prayed we would make it home safe. On the highway, he continued to victimize himself, and accuse me of betraying and abandoning him (when HE had jumped out of the car). He sped then slammed on the breaks, nearly knocking the breath out of me. Then, twice, he opened up his car door, unbuckled his seat belt, and dangled himself outside of the car while screaming at me that he would jump. I mentally prepared myself to die on that highway. Two days later, after developing a plan, I left with my budgie. He begged me to come back. I got a ticket to fly away, and the night before he messages me telling me he got an unemployment check from me. He refused to drop it off anywhere, forcing me to meet him to get it. I told him we would meet inside a grocery store, and I brought backup who stood nearby unbeknownst to NEX. At the grocery, NEX had that predatorial stare in his eyes as he repeatedly asked me to go on a walk with him though I said ""no"" over and over again until my backup entered the situation and stood up for me. I flew across the country the next day. As soon as I got back, he started making threats such as: ""this isn't over,"" ""I will find you,"" and ""You will see."" I made a police report, bought a new phone, changed my number. Deleted my social media, entirely, except for one account for my budgie which I had begun building a business around, but of course I blocked him there too. EVERY DAY he created a new IG account, and tried to add me (there are 35 total- so far). Those accounts had messages written to me in their bios, sometimes pictures of me included in the profiles. Most were weepy attempts to make me feel bad for him, some were angry and vicious. I was becoming exhausted, and feeling like blocking him wasn't working. So, I stopped blocking him. He immediately commented on a picture telling me he messaged my ex. Later, I found out this was true. My NEX admitted to it, then told me he was drunk the day he wrote to my previous ex ""to get him out of the way,"" then jumped onto a moving car. I let him message me without blocking him, and told myself I would be strong and not look at them or not respond. I failed- having this deep need to defend myself, my reasons for leaving him- to defend my integrity, my sense of self-worth and self-respect. However, it is clear that he has a motive to get under my skin and continue the manipulations with the facade that ""he cares for me,"" and ""still loves me,"" and ""wants to make sure that I'm okay."" Today, he messaged me just to tell me he is worried about my mental health. Why? Because once, five months ago, I told him that I took a sleeping pill, and when I woke up I still felt groggy and for that reason, ""I have a problem with sleeping pills."" Meaning, I don't like sleeping pills, not that I have an addiction to them. I blew up on him telling him the only mental instability I have comes from the TRAUMA he put me through and that it's HIS mental health he needs to be evaluating. He countered by calling me a p\*\*\*y for blocking him, then said I am weak for unblocking him, and that tonight I will go to sleep doubting my decision ""to leave the person who loved me,"" even though that decision was because he physically ATTACKED ME. I am SO angry, people. I just do not know how to get away from this guy who has already destroyed everything I had and forced me to leave my friends, my job, and my all my passions behind in the city I loved to escape him. On top of that, I can't help but feel that I am a loser for being 28, unemployed, living with mom and dad (it's been one month), unable to find work in my industry- and rapidly getting older in a time when it's impossible to ever meet anyone. While I understand I need some time to heal, and I will embrace the time to heal; I can't help but feel like I never will meet someone. Furthermore, being here..alone...isn't helping me heal. I live out in the country without a car, and just sit here thinking all day. Can anyone please relate, validate, or reassure me?"
emotional,I need to get out of my parents basement because my emotionally damaged mother is always on a hair trigger,"I am looking for someone willing to rent out a smallish place in the St Catharines Area near Vale Ave if possible. Here's why:   So my story is I'm the 30 years old I'm currently well I would say trapped in my brand new basement apartment in St Catharines. the problem is that I get along with my father who lives upstairs just fine and even if I don't it's relatively easy to fix any misunderstandings we have by simply leaving it alone for few hours and he just forgets that it even happened. He doesn't hold grudges like for very long like or if at all. Sometimes it's frustrating that he doesn't seem to remember but honestly it's no big deal for me.  MY mother on the other hand she's she's been scarred by 30 years of non-stop stress, abuse and just general b*********** life and I love her.   but we've we lived separately for 5 years back home in Hamilton we literally had our own places and now we're living together. It wasn't even my house, she owned the place and I wouldn't be able to live there without her in any case a fact what she never stops to remind me of every time we had an argument but at least back then we could physically separate and just be in our own separate places.   NOW she's basically emotionally holding me hostage. Just to give you an example from tonight.  Just tonight after she drove me all the way into Hamilton and I got to see my friend for the first time in far too long. So after a completely successful day she had to ruin IT. she got fixated on the fact that I offered to get her something at McDonald's as a thank you for giving me extra time with my friend. cuz she was driving back and somehow the fact that I didn't tell her that I wasn't hungry so she went to drive-thru at McDonald's and turned out that she wasn't hungry or at least that's what she said I don't care if it's true or not and like literally I'm whole minute later we weren't even out of the drive-thru and there was already an argument starting over the detail that  ""why didn't I tell her that I wasn't hungry cuz normally when people you know offer you know that they want something themselves"".   I would imagine that most people would simply be flattered by the thought and either and just be like oh okay you know what, I wasn't hungry I mean we're in the drive-thru now but it's no big deal you know thanks to the thought I can always grab something and take it home you're paying after all.   But not with her and it's getting worse seemingly by the day at this point. Before coming here a food offering was usually good way to stop a fight now apparently it's a good way to start one along with anything else I say that triggers whatever f****** invisible emotional trip wire she's got laid out.  I'm essentially stuck in the basement because it seems that every time I spend any amount of time around her something goes wrong somehow you know I try to do some good and somehow later on it blows up in my face. I try to help with some problem they're having and like it's just not worth it.  IT'S always the same f****** thing with her day and day out basically anytime when when we're alone together and a recently anytime I try to help her with anything now it's she always seems to turn it on into something I did wrong. She literally told me tonight never to help her with anything personal ever again.   I've got no problem with that because the last two times I tried to offer support she found some way turning into something that I done wrong instead of just you know saying thank you for the thought even if it didn't produce the desired results. it's the thought that counts not with my mom at least not anymore and I'm just f****** sick and tired of it and it's been like this pretty much almost non-stop since I came to St Catherine's.  I've got nowhere to go my old place in Hamilton is gone. I can't go and see my friends either without her driving or taking the GO bus. I've got nowhere to stay in Hamilton even if I did go on the bus, BUT all my doctors are back in Hamilton like my dentists there also heard dentist unconveniently enough and that's a very that's like literally in the opposite end of the city the Go Bus terminal.  is it would be a massive bloody hassle to get anywhere in Hamilton or do anything because I'm not even living there so I would have to take a go bus all the way in town and then I would either have to do one very specific thing and get all the way back once again on the GO bus no idea how that works completely unfamiliar with it.  I don't know any of the local bus routes and St catherines I don't know anybody here I don't have any contacts don't have any friends I can just go to for a night for a day and just hang out with and chill down.  She made it very clear today that she's also not willing to help out any meaningful way you know despite the fact that it would do good for both of us because it's like we were apart for 5 years and even then we argue quite frequently whenever we were together so we had more than a few times we had a massive bloody blowouts and didn't so much as speak to each other for like a month and now we're just supposed to somehow get over that?!   it's not going to happen and of course she doesn't want to hear that or doesn't care and she's put all the onus on me to find the place on my own and also to pay for it. This is of course a conveniently ignoring the facts that I will never be able to find a decent place that's even that's any more livable than this on my current situation and until I do I'm not even going to waste my time trying to find a job because I'd be going into work everyday just f***** up from whatever their last b******* argument was.  So I'm in quite the catch 22 or in my case I'd say catch 44 because it's even worse than the catch 22. And get along fine with my dad 90% of the time and there is the time I can just be where he isn't even if we're living the same place and like I said earlier he'll just forget in a fairly short amount of time but with my mom? all drama all the time constantly bringing up the past stuff that happened years ago sometimes it brought up like they have some bearing on the current situation in which they often do but are used completely out of context.   As for finding a place in my own well I would imagine anybody's ever had to leave without much money other than whatever the government's giving them in a place where they're they don't know anybody or anything. I don't even know the local bus routes for f***** sake! You can probably imagine that the position is puts me in and all because my mom is too emotionally f***** up but after years and years and years and years and years of emotional baggage that she was never able to properly deal with.  This if course is despite of course saying that she was able to properly deal with it and she went to therapy and all sorts of other stuff. So she went to a group for abused woman like 10 + years ago?!  Big deal! I did therapy much younger the most ever do! and I don't beat her over the head with the advanced mature therapy I did it such a young age. you know every time we have a fight I don't even think about I mean I just thought about it because I'm taking the time to think about through these things you know but she just pulls that and every other tired old trick out of the bag over and over it just like it's broken record every f****** time it's a bloody broken record.  she keeps bringing it up over and over like it's somehow still relevant despite the fact that she still arguing with me about tiny little insignificant things all the f****** time. I mean it's not like I don't play any part in arguments but recently I've tried to just keep my distance from her, because it's the only option I found that even has a chance at working.   So I can't help her, because that always blows up in my face now. That's new I might add. Before she would USUALLY appreciate the jesture but since moving here NOPE."
physical,How do you deal with seeing them in court? I am scared to death.,"I am terrified of this man. He was not my boyfriend, but a roommate. I told my story here months back. The investigation is complete and the DA might have the evidence turned over by now.   I was raped and strangled. I recorded 1.5 hours of the incident. He violated the PO and I turned it in. I will see him December 14 at the court hearing for just that. I am scared.  Are there ways to not have to be present? I am terrified and the horror of even seeing that ugly, ugly evil man is too much.   How did you all deal with it? He calls me all the time still restricted in the middle of the night. I hate it."
emotional,Emotional abuse or my fault?,"I am trying to figure out if I am abusing my husband or if he is abusing me or both or neither.  My husband is a super nice guy who is very calm and quiet normally. I am a very anxious person and tend to say what's on my mind and I don't mean this to be critical of him, I just wish he would not make me feel bad about everything I do wrong when if I bring up anything about him he gets upset and shuts down.  There have been a handful of instances where he has completely flipped out. He never would hurt me but he got really scary and started bashing his hand against his head in frustration and shaking. He turned into this monster and it was very hard for me because I was physically abused as a child and in a household with a very angry father who beat my mother. I tell my husband I cannot handle when he flips out like this but he says I push him to this behavior. I don't know how to have healthy conversations with him to ask him to do things because in our relationship I always need to fix myself and my issues first. For example, I have ADHD and leave clothes on the floor and I need to clean them up. I do not disagree with this. However, I asked him to get life insurance many years ago because we have kids and it would be very difficult if something happened to him and I had to become a single mother. I took out a policy on myself to make sure he would be ok if I were to die early. But he has still not gotten a policy and now he had some health issues come up where he may not be able to get one. I am the breadwinner in the family and make it possible to afford a house and allow my husband to work part time and be home with the kids. But still I feel like I am a second-class citizen in my home.  The worst is when my husband gives me a mean look and puts his hands to his lips when I accidentally chew with my mouth open. I try really hard not to do this as I know it's a bad habit and not ok, but any slight mouse noises bother him extremely. He treats me like I'm a small child when this happens. I try not to eat around him but this is really sad to me because having meals together as a family is important to me. But we can't do that. I feel like it's my fault. But then is that just because he is being abusive to me? Or is it my fault?  I find it very difficult to be attracted to him anymore because of these behaviors. I still find him physically attractive but the way he treats me like a child I am not interested in being intimate with him. Sometimes when he is with the kids and being a good dad I see what I fell in love with but when it's just us I don't know anymore. I mean I do love him but he seems to dislike me so much, but maybe he feels the same way in reverse. I do nag a lot. I just want him to think about my feelings sometimes.  It is difficult for him because he was raised by parents who are very offbeat and didn't teach him how to be social or have social skills. I knew this when I was dating him but it was comforting as I'm a bit awkward and I didn't feel like I had to pretend to be someone else around him. Now I just feel like he sees me as a child and someone he no longer likes. When in very rare instances he puts his arm kindly on me or hugs me (super rare) I feel uncomfortable like it is a stranger touching me. We haven't been intimate in over a year and we don't kiss or anything. He's always been into very violent and degrading porn so I've often felt I am not able to give him that in our relationship anyway as I'm not the submissive type that he likes. Yet we've been together over 15 years. And we've had many good moments in our relationship too.  How should I view this whole relationship? I'm not sure what to do other than be quiet, not complain about anything, and try to not press his buttons. I do complain a lot. No one wants a wife who constantly complains. But also I don't feel like he tries at all to find out what would make me happy and to do any of those things. He doesn't really care about me I guess?"
emotional,How to know who is the victim and who is the abuser?,"I am trying to figure out who is the victim and who is the abuser in my relationship with my ex bf. Or if we are both abusers and both victims. He says that our feelings are both valid therefore we__e on the same level. I have explained our relationship to so many people and they have taken my side but I believe that they are biased since they have never spoken to my ex, the same goes for my ex in that he has spoken to many people and they have taken his side."

physical,A domestic violence situation I want to better understand.,"I am trying to understand this situation better, and maybe get some better terms for research because I have been on the receiving end of it in my view. Here is the situation I am talking about:  I knocked on my younger sisters door to ask for the keys to the family car as she was not using it but keeps the keys with her. She immediately said no with no explanation as to why, when I asked why, she became agitated and began to yell for me to leave after saying the car is hers now, I never entered the room only stood at the door, then when I did not leave and continued to ask politely ""please could you give me the keys to the car so I can go to the shop for 10 minutes and I'll be back"" she then jumped from her bed, ran over to me, while yelling at me to leave and slammed the door on my face and shoulder, as I was between the doorway, I continued to be calm but did not move and repeated why can't I have the keys, she then elbowed me in the stomach a couple of times and continued screaming at the top of her lungs for me to get out of the room, during this I did not raise my voice or touch her back at all, but refused to be intimidated and leave without the keys.  She then started screaming that I was using my physical strength against her, because I was not moving from the doorway, which is when I started walking back and saying I'm not touching you and you've hit me multiple times, she continued to scream how I was physically intimidating her and slammed the door shut. I was angry lost my temper and slammed the door back open and without entering the room as she was still standing at the door, and tried to snatch the keys from her hand with my hand, but failed to snatch them instead grasping her closed hand and then immediately letting go and then walked away because I could see I had lost my temper.  She then yelled after me and threatening to call the police on me, and told me she was calling our dad, which she did do and proceeded to tell him that I came into her room, grabbed her and pulled her arm behind her back and tried to force her to give me the keys to the car. Very fortunately, because this is not the first time it has happened like this with her, I was recording the whole thing which was unknown to her when she called him. Also if that was true and I was willing to do that, I would certainly have been able to get the keys, which I never did get.  To give context, she has no reason to fear me as I have never attacked her or threatened her in anyway, I am larger than her but she is not small she is 5'11"" and an adult, she claims she does not remember our dad ever being violent but he was when we were little, and it is for that reason that I am especially cautious with women because I understand how a larger man can intimidate a women without actually touching them, as he intimidated me in that way when I was a small boy, we are both young adults now.  Because of what I have seen my father do to my mother, older sister, and myself, I am very aware of my size and strength and am extremely cautious when in a confrontation with a women. I have protected her all her life from her older sister who is very physically violent, but only to the extent that I separate them when they are fighting, I have only ever hit a women once in my life when I was 13 and my older sister had scissors and was attacking my mum and I feared for her life as she was swinging them at her violently, and at this time my older sister was bigger than me, ever since I grew much larger than her I only ever restrained her when she attacked my mother or sister, getting her to focus on her breath and letting her go when she calmed down, which both my little sister and mother would often scream out for me to come help by doing when she attacked them, and were always thankful for after the fact.  I'm sure some might think I am biased in the way I am sharing this story, but I am being as honest and fair as possible in my recounting of what happened, I do not want to share the recording because of personal information was exchanged during the confrontation. It doesn't help me to lie at any rate as I would like to hear what people think. My mother, and my little sisters boyfriend are completely against me, my little sister is my mothers favourite child and it seems she can do no wrong in her eyes, it has always been this way, her BF just saw the damaged door and heard what she told him about it and is of course biased anyway being her boyfriend and not wanting to be against her. He refused to watch the recording, and my mother also says the same, she is not interested. My dad who's opinion I could hardly care less about in this matter did watch it and agreed in the end that she was in the wrong, he does not live with us though and does not speak to my mother.  I believe she knew what she was doing, not wanting to give me the car keys (as the night before I had called her selfish with the car and she was angry about that) she was using the stigma of men being the aggressor to control the situation, she was crying wolf essentially, in my view."
emotional,Emotional abuse or toxic attachment styles?,"I am trying to wrap my head around my relationship which recently ended.   It started with us talking for a while and then going on a first date, this coincided with him beginning a job that made him incredibly depressed, he also told me he didn__ have many friends and had social anxiety.   We would text all day every day, deep flirtatious exciting conversations. I would push for meeting up more/having more dates/moving to an irl form of communication but he would always either stand me up or stonewall.   The New Years before covid I became emotional about how he was treating me like a girlfriend/crush over text but was refusing to make any in real life effort or commitments, he told me that he wasn__ actually interested in me as we had different schedules? and he was planning on moving countries so he was no interested in anyone.  It was confusing because he continued to text me in the same flirtatious/couple like manner instead of cutting me off?  I was understanding but a while after he told me he couldn__ be with anyone, he updated his tinder profile.  I know my reaction was irrational but this upset me very much, he told me he wasn__ interested in anyone whilst still texting me as if I was a girlfriend/fwb and then updated his dating profiles, this made me feel extremely degraded and defective.   After this conversation we continued texting as if we were together and got into the same cycle before of me wanting to make this an in real life thing or even see each other in person, he would make promises after promises and never keep them.   The most degrading time was that Valentine__ Day, he had been telling me for a couple of weeks that he wanted to spend it with me and had all these exciting and romantic plans, but when the day came, he wouldn__ meet me but sent me a bunch of dick pics and went to his family home to spend it with his mother.  He told me he did this because he was extremely upset he had been rejected at a job interview that day.   Then lockdown came, he once again went to his family home and spent all of lockdown there and quit his job, continuing the cycle of texting me as if I was a girlfriend, telling me he loved me, making plans etc. but when lockdown ended, he wouldn__ meet me despite us having plans. He stood me up on his birthday, he said he wanted to spend it with me and I had planned a little celebration for him and the day before he confessed to me that his mother had planned something. This upset me extremely as over lockdown he made extremely romantic and ornate plans for us for when it ended and once it ended he wouldn__ even see me, even when I spent a lot of time, effort and money on his birthday, he still stood me up.  We fought about this for a few days and he confessed that on his birthday he went from __harmacy to pharmacy to collect medication_ to attempt suicide. Insinuating that my upset at him standing me up was driving him to suicide.   He then stood me up on my birthday. I spent the entire day waiting for him. He never came and didn__ even send a birthday card or present.   He treated me in an incredibly abnormal and confusing way and I did not know how to react or handle it. He wouldn__ invite me to his family home (he moved back there permanently over lockdown) and wouldn__ come to mine, he also would hide me on and from his social media__ which hurt a lot because he would like a lot of girls pictures on there. He also told me that he could only be with me/treat me like a normal girlfriend if he had his own place and job.   This cycle continued, it got even more intense and stressful and eventually became abusive. With him telling me that his entire family hated me and that__ why he had to treat me this way and hide me etc. And in my becoming depressed, attempting suicide and developing PTSD.   He then used my suicide attempt as a reason as to why he wouldn__ see me and would only text me.  (During that time, I blamed him for my attempt and he became extremely extremely upset and stressed that that would cause him to get in trouble/get in trouble with the law or be arrested. I regret blaming him directly for my attempt, it was an incredibly toxic and horrible thing to do. The stress of him telling me that everyone hated me and the stress of this relationship causing me to drop out of school got to me, that is not an excuse but an explanation).    This cycle continued and got worse and worse. I was chronically suicidal, depressed and traumatised at the way he was treating me (I was receiving professional help for this) and he was incredibly diminutive and invalidating of how cruel his behaviour towards me was and how it was affecting me.   He told me for weeks that what I was feeling wasn__ normal and that I needed serious help and being depressed/suicidal __ver a boy_ and would give me instructions on what to say to the dr which were again downplaying and diminutive of the situation and putting the blame on me.    His promises got bigger, his future faking got bigger and more ornate which made the blow of him not carrying them out even bigger."
physical,When does adult sexual abuse by an intimate partner become sexual assault?,I am working on closure for a traumatic event; I think it would help if I label it in order to understand why it bothers me so much.   When does sexual abuse become assault or legally punishable?
emotional,I feel like a mod from narcisstic abuse just repeated a lot of the problem-behaviors from people that I feel abused me.,"I apologize for any incoherence... I'm autistic and I'm having trouble overcoming it to the point where I seem like I'm not.  The reasonable accommodation is to ask me to try to clarify things.  The short version is that I posted text from another person on a non-reddit forum for validation that they were being abusive.  I thought I made it clear which person I was, but I'm muted for a month so I can't ask the mod why they seemed to have thought I was the flying monkey instead of the victim.  I can't figure out which rule I broke, and the mod of NA accused me of not reading the rules even though I had but hadn't mentioned that.    I searched for my post, and what came up was me doing the same thing I was banned for now a few years ago for a different thing, so I think that they do allow posting for validation.  The only difference was the level of anonymity, but the forum migrated so that all the links were dead and an internet handle isn't what I would consider worthy of hiding.  I don't think that any of the links even survived the copy-paste.  The part about this that bothers me is that the NA mods muted me without allowing the chance to explain, especially after I told them that it triggers me."
emotional,I broke no contact and I feel hopeless. Help?,"I apologize for this being so long. Here__ so background info We were together for a year, he physically cheated on me 2 days into the relationship, but didn__ tell me until 5 months in. He said it would never happen again, but it continued online with flirting and trying to get pictures. He was also very depressed. He would wake up, play video games till 11, come over my place to sleep, and then immediately want me to take him home in the morning. Then repeat. I would often have to ask him to brush his teeth or shower. I had sympathy, because I__e been there before. But it got worse, he would start arguments with me when I dressed up or put makeup on. Make accusations about cheating. Grabbed my face with both hands and told me if I ever cheated on him he would kill me. Anytime I tried to bring up my feelings, he would scream, yell, break things, hit himself and throw himself back like he was having a tantrum.  He would say that he thought he had NPD or BPD. If he was mad at me he would speed while driving to scare me. He told me that he wanted to kill me, his brother, his mom, and then himself.  There__ more, but I think you get the point. I tried many times to get out. When we got into arguments he would often threaten breaking up. Every time I would try to convince him not to, but the last time I didn__. I just said __kay._  I finally gotten out.   It took a lot of courage to block him, because he was spamming me that he had changed and was going to treat me better. He kept apologizing, but it wasn__ anything I hadn__ heard before. I__e been no contact for 4 months. Until one day at work,  (his mom works with me)  She walks up to me and asks when I__ going to get back with her son and that she misses us together. I told her I didn__ want to and that there were a lot of things she doesn__ know. But..  This leads to me falling into it again. I know I fucked up, I unblocked him and he texted me.  He kept going on about how I never loved him, because I could stick by him threw his flaws. That I was selfish and completely ghosted him. That he__ working on changing. No one is good or bad and everyone is selfish sometimes. That his mistakes don__ define him.  We continued to argue over text and he kept spam calling me. Saying things about how he doesn__ remember my voice and that I won__ even pick up the phone. So my dumb ass answered. We continued to argue. I was so upset that he said I never loved him or cared about him. I think that part of me was genuinely curious if he had changed or was working on it. I started to ask him about his life, I__ he__ going to therapy. The more he talked I realized he hadn__ changed at all. He had no sympathy towards me and everything that happened. He wanted me to drive up to see him THAT DAY and spend 5 days together. That we could start fresh and create new memories. I asked questions like __hat would happen after that?_ And __hat__ the rush,_. I never agreed to anything. I told him I had to go, to text me later or something. He asked me if he could see my face on FaceTime. I said no and hung up the phone.   He kept calling later that night and texting. Saying that he misses me and wanted to talk again. After taking the time, I realized the mistake I made talking to him again. I never responded to him.  In the morning he started calling and texting again. He even had his mom call me. He said he was worried. I told him I was fine and that I actually couldn__ talk to him anymore. That after speaking to him, I realized he hadn__ changed and that after everything, I wouldn__ be able to trust him again.  He freaked out. He told me that I lead him on. Said he originally wish me the best, but not anymore. Said that I was traumatizing him and fucked with his feelings once again. And basically told me to go fuck myself.  I never replied and just blocked him.   I feel insane once again. I know I shouldn__ of broken no contact. My friends say he__ trying to manipulate me and make me feel bad. I never meant to hurt him or lead him on. I never agreed to anything.  How do I heal from this?"
emotional,My Best Friend may be in a similar situation I was and I don't know what to do,"I apologize if this isn't the right spot for this, I would appreciate it if I could be pointed in the right direction if it isn't.  I am a survivor of an emotionally abusive relationship, I got out of it more out of luck and the abuser growing too tired of dealing with my mental health issues. It took me almost two years to recognize the extent of what she had done.  Unfortunately, my favorite person in the world at the moment who has been wonderful and supportive and everything I've been trying to find in a person has become very suddenly withdrawn with no explanation other than the occasional ""I'm sorry I'm tired"" when previously she had assured me I could always come to her no matter what. This has also coincided with her making some changes that have prevented her from socializing outside of work and her partner, who I was also close with, has ghosted me for over a week now. It was after her partner ghosted me that I noticed the withdrawing behavior and it's only gotten worse.  I don't want to go into full details here, maybe there is somewhere better I can go for help, but I am starting to strongly suspect her partner may be controlling and emotionally manipulating her, I kind of think her partner may have recognized me as a threat (I've been standing up against similar emotional manipulators recently where they could absolutely see) and have opted to shut me out and control their environment, which is tied to my best friend's environment, they are roommates and this partner is helpless without her.  I guess I'll also just say there have been lots of red flags from their behavior on Twitter, including similarities to thinking patterns my abuser had, they are very smart and aware of psychology as well as the dynamic they are in with their partner, and my confirmation bias is really damn strong in favor of this person I loved them too but all answers keep pointing to my worst fear.  Also, they tweeted the other day about how they ""think sometimes about how if they lost their supports (their partner/my best friend) they would just be helpless and die."" and I guess I can't help but think about how that sounds a hell of a lot like threatening suicide if left, just in well, a more subtle way. Like I said, this person is smart.  I'm really really scared. The friend is someone who saved my life, I'm not sure I'd be here still if it wasn't for her. I have learned to let go of toxic people, but I can't let her go, I can't stand the thought of any hurt coming to her and if she's getting used like I was I just don't know what to do, because I didn't have any idea and refused to let anyone talk poorly about my abuser for over a year after she left. I can recognize it, I don't know what to do about it."

physical,Concerned Neighbor,"I believe I am hearing a DV situation every few nights (so far its happened only twice, but scared me enough to get my adrenaline going) from the same couple. It always happens around midnight and our street is poorly lit, so I cant even identify them and I cant tell which house they come from because Ill just suddenly hear the woman scream by the house with the man following and saying abusive things or ""baby I love you, i promise"".  I also live in an area where weapons are very prominent and I have no self defense available. What can I do to help? Because the two times the police were called, they came about 10-15 minutes after the commotion and the couple is far gone on a different block (you can literally hear them yelling at each other from far away). The cop only ever stays for about a couple minutes then leaves.   Im just extremely concerned for this person after the experiences Ive heard so far, I want to know how I can help with how little information and resources I have."
physical,"Groups or resources for abused men in san antonio, TX??","I broke out of a really bad relationship about a year ago that was filled with physical and verbal abuse and I think I'm finally ready to talk about it but have discovered that there are VERY few resources for group sessions (I cant afford individual counsel) and none of which are for men, suggestions?"
physical,Am I wrong? Is it my fault?,"I called him the ___ word and he hit me multiple times in the face. He said that he hit my because I got in front of him when he was trying to walk away, which I did? Did I deserve what happened? I called him the b word so is it my fault?    Also, it considered abuse if there are no marks on my face and I provoked the situation?"
physical,I made the first step,"I called the local domestic abuse shelter and set up a time to talk to an advocate next week.   It's taken me two weeks since the latest event to call.    My husband wants to start couples therapy.  I said no,  not again.  The last time he turned everything into my fault.   He said he didn't even remember that we ever went to couples therapy let alone how it went!  He said he'll do individual therapy.   He convinced his last therapist that it was my fault and that I just nagged too much.   I don't have much hope for therapy."
physical,Worried it__ never going to get better.,"I cheated. I told my husband over COVID after a heated argument we were having. It just_came out. He always said he wouldn__ be able to handle me cheating.   It__ been 20 months now. He was never violent before he knew I cheated.   But now he throws things, he punches holes in walls, he pushes me up against walls, he doesn__ let me sleep, he picks me up aggressively by shirt. And I__ a fighter- I fight back. I__e kicked, hit, yelled, thrown things. I accidentally broke a window in his the other day. Mostly in defense but definitely out of anger sometimes.   He__ strategic. Never left a mark on me. He validates being violent towards me. I __ade him this way_.   I__ questioned constantly, which is fine. I get it. But it almost always is accompanied by verbal assaults about how horrible of a person I am, how I__ toxic and so are my family friends. I__ a monster, I__ vapid, I__ disgusting- I could keep going.   We__e both guilty- I__e done things I__ not proud of. I want to break this cycle. This isn__ who I am. But it doesn__ feel like he wants to break it.   I constantly wonder if I deserve this. I feel like I do."
emotional,Is this abuse?,"I consider my mother my best friend, and she considers me hers. There are plenty of times when we get along, but there are also times when it gets a little rocky. Here are a few examples.   1. Calling me names like slob, skank 2. Telling me I__ over dramatic  3. Yelling/screaming  4. Threatening to leave me and my brother 5. Being passive-aggressive (slamming doors, stomping when she walks, slamming drawers closed and throwing things down)  6. Refusing to talk to us when she__ angry   There are a lot more incidents, but whenever things like this happen, I find that I can__ remember them all unless I write them down. We just had an argument the other day where she told me I was a disgusting slob, but then she apologized for it later.   Is this abuse or am I actually just overly sensitive?"
physical,Our relationship is perfect in every other way,"I couldn't put more flairs, so TW: PA, SA,   I can't even describe the sheer amount of guilt I'm feeling for even reaching out. For even thinking that my partner is in any way hurting me or putting me at risk. I'm so, so confused. What if *I'm* the problem?   They give me everything. They have a great job and I don't have to work. We have a home, a dog, no kids. We go on dates. They buy me all my clothes, food, laptops, games, makeup...  But because of that, it's like I don't have a voice. I have a place in our relationship and they make sure I know it. They work, and I cook, clean, and satisfy. If I don't, I'm a piece of shit. I'm out of place. I don't argue because they'll guilt me until I don't have the strength to defend myself anymore. I don't talk back because they'll slap me. I don't say no to sex because if I do, they'll just make me. It's easier to say yes, to pretend to like it when they choke me and tell me how worthless I am.   And the worst part, the WORST part, is that I ask them to do it. They love me more when I give them a reason. I'm so lost. I feel like such a shit person. I should be grateful for everything they do. So why am I always trying to find a way out? I love them more than anything in the entire world. And I'd rather die than hurt their feelings. I don't know what to do anymore. The only thing that gives me comfort anymore is planning my death. I'm lost and I'm scared. What do I even do?"
emotional,Am I being emotionally abused or just sensitive?,"I created a throwaway account because somehow my husband found my Reddit account and even though he is blocked he still __ollows_ it and can see everything I post so I don__ feel safe posting anything ok that account relating to him. He comments on it and I can__ see it or anything... then he screenshots it to use as __vidence_ against me and lets me know he has a whole file against me.   Well my husband left me in September 2020. He moved out and got an apartment like basically overnight. Well he left me because he thought I was having an affair. However; when he left me he told me it was because he was __ay_ and he wanted to figure it out. Then after I told his mom and sister in law what happened then he said he was not gay he just had a pornography addiction and fell out of love with me. Okay. Whatever. Then he told everyone in my life I had an affair without ever posing it to me. I actually found out from our pastor that that is the reason he left. My husband kept pressing me to see if I would tell him anything. So I ended up admitting to an __motional affair_. I use this term loosely because it wasn__ that. It was me talking with a former sexual partner and communicating about work and such. I was unhappy in my relationship and getting attention from someone who actually wanted to talk to me felt good.  We never connected physically. Sometimes he would say risqu_© things and I wouldn__ shut him down. But we never hooked up. I never sent pictures. We didn__ like FaceTime. It was literally a friendship with someone I had a previous connection with. Anyways, I realize it was inappropriate and I shouldn__ have engaged in the friendship. And I should have stopped talking to him. I should have worked on the issues in my marriage. Whatever. It__ all water under the bridge now because he left me and demanded a divorce. He went on and had a sexual relationship with someone else and so did I. I had a PFA against him so I couldn__ speak to him. Eventually he reached out to me, through his mother, asking to drop the PFA so we could __ork on reconciliation_.   So far, our reconciliation hasn__ been that. He does this thing where he pulls me in close, has sex with me; then he needs __pace._ But instead of telling me he needs space, he just starts to ignore me. He gets to the point where it__ days he doesn__ answer me then he says __ still need space._ He always needs this space after he has sex with me. Then he will do things like insult me. He says that we __ucked up_ when we had sex. But he never just straight up tells me until I blow up on him. When I call him, he ignores all my calls. He will occasionally text back one or two provocative things but never allow the phone call to be answered. He often laugh reacts to my texts but doesn__ respond (iMessage).  He tells me __orry I was making a TikTok_ but then never gets back to me. It__ like he always pushes me down the priority list. If I tell him I don__ want this to work out anymore, he says __k bye_ like he doesn__ even care that I don__ want to be together. It__ almost as if he just wants me to break it off so he doesn__ look like the bad guy.   Here is a link of an example on how he responds to me when I__ just trying to talk with him: https://imgur.com/a/WM4JOiQ  In addition to this, he will invite me over sometimes but thEn never follow through. Like he will just say __ assumed you realized you weren__ welcome over after we were fighting_ or he will say things like he knew we were going to have sex so he has to push me away.    Honestly, it__ at the point where I think I am crazy. However, I only think this when I talk to him.  If I say anything to him about what he__ doing is wrong he will say __ow is ignoring a text emotional abuse._ He will accuse me of gaslighting him if I say anything he doesn__ like. It__ like he doesn__ realize his actions have any affect on me but I__e had to call the suicide hotline twice because of him. If I try to talk to him he says __ texted your mom and sister_ to try to embarrass me into dealing with my issues myself. Idk guys.   I__ honestly so confused. But last time this happened I ended up in the psych ward."
physical,Update: Last Sunday a mutual friend of ours grabbed me by the neck and through me down his staircase while my wife egged him on... (TW: Gore),"I did end up going to the hospital. At 5 am in the morning I snuck down into the bathroom, turned the fan on and quietly contacted my insurance company to see which local hospital would accept them. He emailed me a list of hospitals and I summoned an uber, waiting in the dark around 5, 5:15 am. About two minutes before the Uber came, my wife started screaming at me, telling me to come back to bed. I lied and told her that I was playing on my iPad. I had tried to be quiet, but I had wanted to gather some spare clothes or something. I think it was me opening the top shelf to get a pair of socks that woke her up. Fuck socks. (I ended up going without them.)  When the uber came, I unlocked the door and bolted with what few things I could secret out. I didn't have time to lock the door behind me.  The advising physician told me that I had experienced a ""medium sized"" concussion five days ago, but that it was too late to do anything about it. The MRI revealed no internal bleeding at the moment. They told me to go home at around 11 am, and I returned to the house. I do not know how I will afford the MRI, or even the modest deductible.  This week has been very bad. I feel like my body is unwinding. I am afraid I might die. The bruising is coming in.  This morning I woke up at 6:30 am barely able to move on my right side. At around 8:30 am I took a shower, and saw one of the nastier bruises. I am afraid it is not getting better.  I woke her up and asked her to take a look. She looked and me and said, ""I don't see any bruising."" I pointed at the bruise on my side, and she said, ""Oh that? You woke me up for that?"" and rolled over and went back to sleep.  Later on, around 11:30 am, I was trying to do some online banking and having some trouble logging on. She started screaming at me again. I told her to ""Shut the fuck up"", which I thought would make me feel better, but didn't. She said, ""God, ever since that one time, you've been so fucking nasty. Just get over it already. I'm sorry you're a fucking retard.""  \*Edit\* The moderators made me take down the picture the bruise. Obviously it is very large with a dark black nucleolus, spreading out into a larger purple ring. I would say it is  \~12"" in diameter or so. \*End Edit\* Am I taking crazy pills? How could she not see that?"
physical,My abuser also recently abused his current wife yet still has court ordered visitation with our child. Need advice.,"I divorced my abuser around 9 years ago.  There were so many incidents that they__e all sort of blended together in my mind but on various occasions he__ choked me, punched me, shoved me, and even slammed my head into a piece of furniture which needed staples to close the wound. I was living with him at the time and had little resources, no family nearby so I never reported him to the police. I was also terrified he would retaliate if I called police or possibly kill me so I just gathered evidence in secret and planned my exit. During the course of gathering evidence, I found he had been arrested at one point for strangling his girlfriend before me and charged with domestic violence, but she refused to testify against him and the case was dismissed.  I finally left him after he took my child  from me and kept them, refusing to disclose their location. I was awarded primary custody in our divorce due to the violence and he was given a standard visitation schedule.   Since then, he hasn__ hurt or threatened me or my child, but I__e had two other women who he__ lived with reach out to me to tell me he__ abused them. Neither of them called the police and I__e never had any physical evidence to take back to court to ask that his visitation be stopped or reduced.   Recently I received a call from his current wife who said he was in jail for strangling her and threatening to kill her. They are separated and he apparently traveled to the state she is living now (not the state he lives in) under the pretense of picking up some of his stuff and took a rifle and in the checked baggage on the plane. They got into an verbal altercation because she wouldn__ get back with him when he attacked her. She was worried about the kids so she called all of the moms of his children to let them know. She was awarded a protection order against him and He was charged with a felony DV charge, but the criminal trial is pending.   I went back to court with my lawyer and asked that his visitation be supervised because of the history of violence and continuing pattern. We were hoping his current wife would testify and while she gave a written statement, her lawyer advised her not to testify because of the pending criminal case.  My request for supervised visitation was denied. The judge essentially said since this alleged incident happened in another state and none of the children were present coupled with the fact there__ been no violence against me since the divorce that there__ no reason to modify the visitation orders.   I__ sick and not sure what to do next. My ex is clearly volatile and I worry that one of the kids or another woman will get hurt. The fact that he has multiple guns and took a gun when he traveled to visit this woman is also scary. I also worry about what behaviors my child is being exposed to. I want to make sure my child is protected but feel like unless he hurts me or my child in a new incident, I don__ have any recourse.   Has anyone dealt with this before? Could use some advice"
physical,All this time later and I__ still broken,"I do want to start off by saying I am in therapy with someone who specializes in domestic violence and sexual trauma. It has been 7 months since I__e spoken with my abuser and 9 since he got locked up for his most recent attack on me. He__ been in a outpatient program behaving himself since he got released in May.   When a man expresses interest in me now I shut down. Weather I would be interested in them back or not, it__ triggering. I feel defeated and broken beyond repair. I__ still fixated on the false him despite all this time in therapy I remain stuck in this place. My feelings for him are still the same and it feels unfair and straight up impossible to try to date. It__ like he__ stolen my ability to love. I know it__ bullshit manipulation and that he__ still controlling me, but it__ so convincing and hard to get past. All of my previous relationships before him were consecutively more worse and abusive with him taking the cake. So I__ afraid to even try with anyone else."
physical,Alone in the world,"I don__ have anyone to talk to. No one will help or support me in any way. I__ trying to find work, but it__ confusing because of self doubt and no one to tell me if I__ even making any sense. Sometimes I have to focus on seeking shelter, which is always a dead end so I have to stay at home where my spouse freaks out about once a week. I can__ remember the last time some one touched my hand or gave me a hug. I__ mostly upset that no matter where I turn for help, it backfires or leads nowhere. How do people get back on their feet without a helping hand or something to hold onto?  I feel like I__ trapped behind a wall, kicking and screaming to get out, and anyone who can hear me is just pretending not to notice."
emotional,I feel so isolated,"I don__ know if it__ just the psychology of losing someone who dominated every aspect of my life, or if it__ him acting like a scolded puppy as if he played no part in this, or if I__ just depressed_ but I feel so alone and so vulnerable and so sick right now. We ended things (again) a few days ago and I have just felt so empty since then, but honestly I__e felt empty for a long time. My friends don__ hang out with me anymore because the relationship pushed us apart for so long, my family is busy. I feel so alone in the world. I want to get out and do something but my new medication makes me feel like I__ constantly getting some illness, plus it__ about 800 degrees where I live. I__ also a really anxious person and I have more fun when I__ with someone I know. I feel like I__ trapped in my house. I have no one to talk to. I hate this feeling."
emotional,is it normal to laugh when you__e being abused/mocked,"i don__ know if this is a reaction to trauma. i laugh now instead of feeling hurt, but then i__ left all confused once the moment is over :/"
physical,"I want to be free, but I can__ leave","I don__ know if this is also abuse, but Reddit recommended to post this here instead of another sub I posted this in.   TL;DR how could someone escape from a very controlling relationship?  I (F25) am in a relationship with my bf (M28) for nearly 8 years right now. A lot of stuff has happened between us. Very beautiful and good things but also horrible and terrifying things.   My bf is very controlling and basically decides how I live my life. I have no friends anymore and no contact with my family.  He tracks everything I do and controls who I talk to and who I meet up with. Which is almost no one nowadays because of his behavior in the past.  I really really love him, he is honestly the best person I know when he is in a good or okayish mood. But when his mood gets bad, it gets really bad...   I don__ know what to do anymore, I don__ want to lose him but I also don__ want to live like this anymore. I feel trapped and there is no one I can talk to about this.  (In the past I__e tried to break up with him and been in a women__ shelter for a few months. I felt really safe there but my bf found me through his connections and started threatening me and my 2 supervisors from that place. I had to go back to him. The controlling behavior only got worse after that and is still happening to this day. I don__ trust police either, because in the past I had really bad experience with them. They tried to break up my relationship, pressured me to choose between my bf and my family and own life, said they would be there for me but just used me to catch my bf... that__ not a way for me anymore. I really gave it a chance)"
physical,No one cared,"I don__ know if this is self loathing. I escaped my abusive relationship 10 months ago. Since then has been mainly healing and also avoiding hoovering attempts.   Well one thing that has bothered me incredibly is when I think back to the abuse. I remember multiple times my ex was screaming at me, or blocking me from leaving with other people IN THE ROOM. They didn__ encourage the abuse it__ just_ they didn__ exactly discourage it. I don__ know if I am expecting to much from these people I thought were my friends. I since the breakup have cut all ties with those friends and mutual friends.   I don__ know what I was expecting, but like_. No one even sent a freaking are you ok text? Or does he do this all the time. It__ like_. They didn__ care_.. they liked him more then me Idk_ I hate it"
physical,Do any of you feel it in your gut? That this person could kill you if they wanted to,"I don__ know where to begin.   Sexual Assault, his hands in my mouth, his forearm over my throat whispering __hhhhh_ in my ear....shoving his penis in my mouth....running away...him chasing me...pushing him out of bathroom as I tried to escape.    Towering over me. Threats. Blocking me in rooms. Sharpening knives while glaring at me. Coming toward me with black eyes asking if I had a good time.   His guns.   Cowering over new as he raged at me.   Slamming his fists down into the bed.   Chasing me from room to room.   Making me repeat statements I knew to be false.   Face twisted with rage.   Abusing my dog.   It__ all frantic thoughts right now.   It__ coming back to me in waves. Nightmares.   Drowned it out with alcohol.   Feeling afraid for my life."
emotional,Anyone else jumpy and on edge around loud sounds and too much noise?,"I don__ think I would actually be diagnosed with cPTSD or anything, but following the emotional, psychological, and verbal abuse from my SO, even after having left 3 months ago, I find myself on edge and still super jumpy around loud sounds. I__ staying with my parents until I get my feet under me. Their 2 dogs barking make me so anxious and freak the crap out of me sometimes when the bark is sudden. I get overwhelmed easily with multiple conversations going on. Is this fairly normal?"
physical,I'm told it's abuse but I'm not sure,"I don't even know how to put this into words. It's long.   I am a 32f who married a foreigner 9 years ago and live in his country of nationality. Last May the relationship came to an end with him alleging domestic abuse, saying that I assaulted him one night when I was very depressed and drunk, having me arrested, pursued an assault charge against me, said I threatened to kill my children, used this to have me kicked out of my home and the lives of my 2 young children. I had nowhere to go and moved to a different city where my mother had a friend with a spare room.    In the meanwhile, my ex-husband didn't let me see my children then enforced rules on how I can see them and I took the matter to court. Social services became involved and he told them all sorts of lies about me saying that I withheld food from my eldest child to punish her, or threw her dinner away then gave her unhealthy food to eat, neglected her and made her look after her younger brother etc.  He also told me to leave the country and leave my children.      The way he was so vindictively doing things made me suspect something. 2 weeks before the incident where he says I assaulted him, I was very depressed and suicidal. I told him I want to die and asked him for his prescription medication to overdose on. He gave them to me and left me to it. I took the pills and told him I was going to sit in the car to die. He just let me. When I woke the next morning, scared after realising I hadn't died, I went back to the house and asked him to call and ambulance. He hesitated. He did call for one in the end but didn't bother to come to the hospital to see me until many hours later. I have had depression since I was a teenager.      I started suspecting that I had been a victim of domestic abuse for years. I called a helpline and told them my story. I was told that I have highlighted coercive control, gaslighting and one incident of rape. I then had to begin the painful process of believing that I had been abused and that my ex-husband seems to have set a trap for me to get me out of his life and that I stupidly fell into that trap. He had previously threatened to revoke my visa and have me leave the country without my children. In the months before the incident, when I expressed to him that I don't think our marriage is working, he told me once again that I could leave the country.  Seems like he's made good on his threats as I am fighting to remain in the country now. He even filed for a  divorce on my birthday. I went to the police to report the domestic abuse but I had terrible anxiety after that and had to retract my report for the sake of my mental health.     He actively pursued assault charges against me and I tried to fight them. But I had no defence as I was intoxicated. The law frowns upon that. It didn't matter what he did before, all that mattered was that one incident. He also asked for a restraining order if I get convicted. I did get convicted, and he was granted a restraining order aginst me. He won't speak to me about our children, he won't involve me in decisions about them. Luckily I had the support of a DV organisation who helped me source a family lawyer and immigration lawyer.   Needless to say, this has hit my mental health hard. It's been a struggle to accept that I gave many years of my life and sacrificed a lot only to have it all taken from me overnight. I've lost my children.      This brings me to my current situation. I am living with a much older man. It started innocently enough with him letting me lodge in his spare room and providing me with emotional and mental support. As I could not pay any rent, I offered to cook and clean in return. The relationship became sexual and feelings became involved. But he would never 'put a status on it'. I have been referred to as his friend, lodger, flatmate, girlfriend. He said he doesn't like to label relationships, despite having had numerous girlfriends in the past. He is physically gentle and never aggressive. Verbally though, he has put me down about my choice of clothes (uncool), told me that anger is not a natural emotion that I am entitled to feel, that my being sad affects him because I'm sharing the space with him and my gloominess brings him down, that it is selfish of me to be angry or sad around him. He has told me that if I'm going to be gloomy then go do it in my own space. I thought I could go do it in my room, but even then the room is used as his office and exercise room too. So I don't actually have my own space.      On Sundays I tend to be upset all day because I speak to my children on the computer in the morning and it hurts me when my children are allowed to be distracted during the call and I have to stare at an empty screen sometimes. Last Sunday after the call, I asked my flatmate if he'd like to go for a walk later. He said maybe. I went to my room, shut the blinds and door and lay in bed for a while. He asked if I was unwell or down. I told him I was down. He asked about the walk and I said no initially then thought it would be better for me to get out so we did go for a walk. It was uncomfortable. Later that day he said something about that, that I went to the room and was laying in the dark and it would be better if I didn't feel down at all. That by now I should have built a mechanism to shield myself from being upset by the calls with my children.   A few days before that he was behaving unempathetically while we were out. Throwing food for birds near us even though I had just said that I'm scared of birds. Asking me if I was going to take a homelss guy home when I saw one and commented on the poor man. And when I told him that I find myself wanting some of my belongings from my ex-husband that I've had since I was a child or teenager, he told me those are just things. I said that those things are mine and have memories for me. He argued that the memories are in my mind and that should be enough and that things like books can be replaced. He said that objects are just objects, yet when I asked him how he would feel if I were to get rid of some of his seemingly unimportant objects (and there are lots) he said that would be unacceptable as that would be me taking control of his posessions. He also reinterated his possession of the space that I am living in by asking me, where am I going to put those things if I manage to get them from my ex.     He treats me with disrespect a lot of the time. Like I'm his servant. He barely responds when I say something that he doesn't find interesting because he says why should he pretend to be interested? He is dismissive of me when I talk to him while he's doing something, yet he constantly talks to me when I am watching videos or trying to read. Yet he looks after me too. When I am too fatigued or upset to buy food and cook, he does it. He has taken me to the doctor when I have been very depressed.     I spoke to my DV support worker. I told her it feels unhealthy for me to have to suppress my feelings and be told they are inappropriate. I told her I feel like I don't have my space. I asked her if it's abusive and she said yes. It is controlling and manipulative. That he gets a lot out of me being here: companionship, housework and cooking, sex....   I told her that it feels wrong to say that someone who put a roof over my head and fed me when I couldn't afford anything for myself is abusing me. She said that gratitude does not excuse controlling behavior and that the power dynamics in this relationship have been skewed from the beginning making it easy for me to be abused. She told me she can help me get out of here and into a refuge or a room somewhere if I am homeless due to domestic abuse.   This feels so wrong. Months ago I had to accept that I had been in an abusive marriage. Now I have to question if I am in an unhealthy and abusive situation that I should get out of. Yet I am scared. I have never lived alone before. I have no family nearby."
emotional,Emotional abuser seeking to change,"I dont know if i can post here or not. If not feel free to remove my post.  I am 37m and i am an emotional abuser of my gf 37f. We have been together for 7 years and have a 2 yr old son together. Recently everything came to a head and we sat down and she explained to me what i had been doingto her for a few years now. Putting her down directly, complaining about her to our friends, making her feel unwanted unloved. That i have pushed her away. We had been barely having sex, we rarely get to go out due to our schedules. She feels alienated by her family who hasn't realized she has withdrawn and more.  After we talked it really clicked in my head what i was doing. I had not realized that i was being an emotional abuser.. i thought we all complain about our partners/spouses. That we all have times where we are less active sexually, or talkative to each other..  Once i saw this... i realized what i was.. that i was doing some of the things that my mother did to my brothers and I growing up. That i was taling out my frustration by putting her down. I cried a lot.. more than i have in years. I sat there letting it all sink in, running it over in my head.. what an asshole i am god I'm my mother.. the think i strived so hard not to do and here i am doing it. I stopped right then and there.. it has only been a little over a month since this happened and i never want to go back to being that person, i will have to keep vigilant so i dont. In the time since,  i have strived to do all the things i should have been doing. Ive started therapy, once a week to break thru my issues, discover what in my past is triggering this behavior, how i can work to stop it. I have gotten our friends involved with helping me. Ive been open and honest with her and with our friends about everything. I have asked them for their help as well.Coping skills, communication skills. Asking for forgiveness every day. I have taken to asking her if she wants tea or coffee in the morning when i wake up. To cleaning areas she is bad about cleaning herself instead of being upset about her not doing it. Ive taken to buying flowers again. Trying to take her out. Massages, foot rubs, scratching her head like she likes. Telling her i love her multiple times a day when i get up, to texts, to at night in bed.  Ive read several books including one that would help the abused and the abuser both. The emotionally abusive relationship how to stop being abused and how to stop abusing. It opened my eyes to even more of my behaviors and some of the root causes of it.  Right now we are in limbo on where the relationship is going.. we have spent more time together, both said i love you more, held hands, and have had more sex in this month than the rest of the year. But right now she is debating on whether she wsnts to stay or go.  I know that a little over a month is not much time to prove ive changed and will continue to seek change and help. I know she is scared, that she worried that this is me trying to save us and might just stop if she stays.   I wish i could let her see into my mind and heart. To see the conviction i have for this. How I'm afraid to lose her. How im scared to death of being my mother.  I don't know what the future will hold, but i keep being told that i should make these changes for myself. Be ready for her to leave. Keep changing if she leaves so it doesnt happen again. I plan to keep going to therapy either way. But if she leaves it will be so painful.. i can't beleive that i treated the love of my life like this. I don't know what advice I'm seeking because i still feel lost and overwhelmed by what i did, and info overload from all im reading and therapy. Thank you to any who read this and those who may offer advice or encouragement."
emotional,For people who need to hear this on Mother's day,"I don't know your situation. That's ok. The exact details don't matter.   You deserve all of the love in the world. You deserve people.who love you for you. No question. You deserve to be loved for all of your human, imperfect self. You deserve people who are proud of you and love you unconditionally.   Its gonna be ok."
physical,Just looking for some advice,"I don't really know what to put this post under so I do apologise if it's not the correct flair.   I've recently just gotten out of an abusive relationship that only lasted around 6 months. The relationship was abusive in many ways and by the end of it I feared for my own life. If it wasn't for my mum I wouldn't have put my foot down two days ago and finally left.  My mum advised me to go to the police station to write a statement on him (which I feel horrible about doing, and don't understand why I do,) and have an IVO put against him.   I feel horrible. I don't know how to get past all these feelings that I'm seeming to be flooded with over the last three days (since I finally left) and I'm just really looking for some advice on how to help myself not hurt so much, because it's pretty hard at the moment."
physical,I'm really struggling to move on,"I don't really know why I'm posting this, I just need to vent I guess.  I was in a very physically and mentally abusive relationship for 5 years, I escaped 8 months ago. The worst time he hurt me keeps replaying in my head even though it's been almost 2 years.   DESCRIPTION OF ABUSE   I was sleeping, and I woke up to him punching me in the stomach, shouting asking if I was pregnant, I wasn't, I was on the implant. I don't even know where he got the idea from. These were full blown, full power swings. He moved onto my face and it's a bit of a blur around there but he also started to bite my face full force and my arms. I was crying and confused and panicking, I really still to this day don't know what I did to upset him. He went out of the room and grabbed a knife, the knife he grabbed wasn't a particularly sharp one, it had trouble slicing through pizzas sometimes lol. This part happened so fast, he grabbed my arm and cut across the top of it, my arm instantly burst open and there was blood spraying out. Thank god he went for my arm, because the past few times he started on my neck, and I truly believe I'd be dead now if he did.  He snapped out of it at this point and called an ambulance saying I'd self harmed, he considered not calling them and stitching it up himself but there was so much blood I think he knew it was more serious than just closing the wound. The blood had soaked through the mattress and into the floor, even though I was holding a tea towel over it and I threw up because I was panicking. He ended up slicing through some tendons and I had to have surgery to try to correct it.  I'm in so much pain with my arm and hand daily, most people in my life still think it's a self harm scar, he completely got away with it. To be honest, I don't think I'd even feel better if he was punished for it :/ I guess I'm more angry at myself for not leaving sooner, this whole thing could have been avoided ughhhh."
physical,Unhelpful response when reaching out for help,"I emailed my priest for support.   I told him I've been getting sexually abused for years in my marriage.   He said,  ""The first thing I would suggest, is that if this is going on, please consider_talking to the police.""  If this is going on? Yes,  it is.   But I can't call the police unless he hits me or rapes me.   And now that he knows I'm close to leaving,  he is being careful and not abusive.   Also,  I can't call the police for him coercing me to have sex,  not respecting my boundaries, grabbing me when I'm not expecting it, etc.  It's enough to make me on edge, but not enough to get him arrested."

physical,"Was this abuse, or just a family joke","I feel like I was abused but I'm not sure if it was abuse or just something different.  I used to live in a house with the abusive stepfather, and abusive brother, AB is something like 24 and ASF is like 36. On numerous occasions AB has hit me, and choked me until I passed out and at one point he even tried to stab me, he missed his shot what was going towards my stomach but it slit my wrist and I still have that scar to this day, AB abuse was much more private and it only stayed inside of the house, however ASF was not bothered about abusing me in public. One time me and ASF were crossing this field where he choked me until I passed out and left me there stranded, in the middle of nowhere. Another time we were out shopping and ASF bought three bottles of washing up liquid and he forced me to drink one of them, like he shoved the cap inside of my mouth and would just keep squirting it inside of my mouth and if I spat it out he would punch me in the stomach, so I had no other choice but to swallow the washing up liquid.  Those were just a few times about my story and I just don't know whether it was abuse or just some sort of family joke thing.  Just some info I was 9-12 ( am 16 now) when I was living in that household and I tried telling the police about it when I was about 11 and they wouldnt believe me because they thought that I was just a kid making up a story for attention."
emotional,I'm always so scared to think I might be emotionally abused,"I feel like it's not real, like I'm making it up. ""It's not that bad""   ""I've done bad stuff too""   ""He didn't mean it that way and you're being sensitive. He just doesn't think things through before he says them""  I feel like I read these stories of people going through similar stuff and I tell myself that I'm purposely reading myself into if, that I'm just trying to be a victim or something.   And I feel so trapped and confused. I have no idea what I want. Am I sabotaging myself? Is this actually an okay relationship that I'm just trying to ruin?  No one had ever cared about me in a similar way and yet...I see the gaslighting and lies and hypocrisy and it makes me so mad and sad and at the end of the day it feels like this is what I deserve."
emotional,abusive mother,"I feel like my mother ruins everything for me. shes ruined my chances of seeing my bf, shes also ruining my chances of seeing my best friends. I feel so alone. im not allowed to go out unless its with the family and I cannot do anything unless shes around. I am 16 years old. I can look after myself. I don't even do anything wrong. im not a bad kid but I constantly get treated like it. I feel so stupid. and its so unfair. why do other kids my age or younger than me have it easier than me? why cant I have fun like my friends and other kids my age/younger do?? I feel like im getting mentally worse and worse and its eating me up. I dont know if I can keep going. im going to fucking break one day. it hurts so bad. shes so abusive towards me &amp; its traumatised me, she invades my privacy, she has groped me, she has hit me, she has manipulated, gaslighted and traumatised me. im so tired of it and I cant even say everything shes done because then this is gonna be way too long."
physical,Why is this so hard?,"I finally stopped at the police station to get information on how to get out of my abusive relationship. I__ glad, and it made me feel better. I was packing my things, and tried to escape the other day, but he came home before I was able to leave. I have two cats I need to keep safe as well which is a bit very inconvenient. I have no place to go. I work at a hotel, and waiting for my manager to come back, and see if I can stay at the hotel. I also thought about driving 8 hours to go to my narcissistic fathers house because my bf has threatened to call him and basically threaten him so part of me just wants to show up at my dads this week, and assure him I__ safe and just fill them in. At the same time my family has also been another huge source of my mental health problems. I just feel so stuck like the information I__ given isn__ helping me move forward like I want it to. I__ also a bit embarrassed to bring this matter up to my manager. I just feel so overwhelmed with everything. I have ppl pressuring me to leave or do this or that, and it__ just not helping.__...I__ just exhausted by the abuse; and a lot the times I__ just trying to tell him what he wants to hear to stop the abuse."
physical,Not sure what to think or do..,"I found this forum today and I__ hoping to get some good insight. Last night my husband and I got into a huge fight. His daughter (my stepdaughter) did something pretty messed up, long story. But it started with me asking him to talk to her, she__ done messed up things before and when I tell her he needs to address what happened this time he says I__l do it and waives me off. I make a point to tell him I really need you to get through to her this time, if she__ old enough to date and demand our respect she__ old enough to answer for her actions. That__ all I said.. I__ 5 months pregnant with a baby we planned and very much want. He tells me in response __hut the fuck up you fat fucking bitch_ shouts it loud enough for my child (his stepchild) to hear. I tell him not to take out his anger at his child__ actions on me and go to put my child to bed (she lives with us full time). While I__ walking down the hall and putting her to bed he keeps screaming __ou fat disgusting bitch_ he was high on weed.. but that__ it.   I return to our room and he__ eating cereal in bed I nudge the bowl and some cereal gets on his shirt and lap and I guess I taunted him saying __eah I__ just a big fat fucking bitch right_. The bowl is still here basically full, not much got on him.  He gets up rips his shirt off grabs me hard by both my arms pushes me down on our bed and starts screaming in my face __ou wanna go_ and other things I don__ remember. He__ pinning me to the bed yelling in my face and I just kept repeating I__ pregnant you need to get off of me. He then gets up shatters a big glass cup on the floor and then goes into our bathroom and breaks my mirror smashing it onto the shower floor. He then goes downstairs to sleep on the couch.   I feel numb. I__ shocked by his actions. He pushed me one time 2 years ago during a fight and restrained me from leaving. After that we made up and he promised he would never put a hand on me again. I am due in a few months and need a c section. I have nowhere to go. I have no family remotely close. I have nobody to help me with this baby but HIS family. We__e been together 5 years but are recently married (end of October). Our house is in his name but I__e always paid half of everything.. do I have to leave? Can I make him leave? Do you think this is my fault for spilling cereal in his lap on purpose? Is this something counseling can help? Do I file a police report to document the incident? I don__ know what to do and feel like I can__ tell anyone.."
emotional,Soul crushingly lonely,"I gave her the separation paperwork. I am applying for places to live. And I am not engaging in her drama. But now I am terribly lonely. Like soul crushing lonely. It makes me rethink a lot of this. It makes me terrified for living alone. I once read how people have described leaving an emotionally abusive relationship like getting off drugs. How tjetr are withdrawal type symptoms. I keep telling myself this when I feel like relapsing.   I still get up and go to work or go to the gym. Hell my 1.5 mile run time keeps getting better. But I am avoiding people. Habr a hard time interacting with my kids. Its like a sad country song. Ugh I feel so lonely and ashamed, but I know this is the right path. At least I hope it is."
emotional,"Am I over analyzing,because I definitely feel like it?","I got a message from one of my dad saying he wanted me to clean the dishes. Usually every time he wants help with something I do it immediately, or try to get to it as soon as possible.  Today though I saw his message but completely forgot and then an hour passed. I only noticed cause my mom came home and I saw him doing what he had asked of me.  He then called my name with a huge sigh and I quickly apologized and said I would finish it off. He then wouldn__ take it and kept saying....no I__ asked you exactly when to do it, look at the time now, it__ too late now. I felt really guilty and apologized again and he said there nothing to be sorry for now.   I already have someone who is very narcissistic in my house hold and I feel like I__ over analyzing what he was saying but he__ done this severely other times. It__ like he throws a tantrum and won__ except anything other than what he believes and when I went back downstairs usually it could be seen how upset he made me and he takes it in and shows displeasure. But today I didn__ I showed no sign of being upset, I just acted cheerful and he did the absolute same.   Am I the one making this bigger than it is, maybe I__ being dramatic.  Does anyone else go through this? How do you change or deal with it?   I__ sorry it was long I didn__ know how else to shorten it but if u mad sir this far thank you."
physical,"Looking for support/connections, I'm sorry this is so long.","I got into a very serious relationship, at a very young age, with a extremely mentally ill person, a few years my senior.

I don't know that the abusive was intentional at the beginning, (my therapist said this is the Stockholm talking) but once they saw that was a power they had, they sure used it.  I can now identify red flags that I couldn't at that time. I know, that there was abuse from the start, but they quite literally rewired my head, and although I know it's true they were abusive, it's not something I can truly feel, believe, or connect with.  They helped me grow and learn, a lot with my PTSD, from childhood, but as they helped, anything they learned along the way was then doubled back as a means to attack and rewire me.  Triggers were used in arguments if things weren't going their way, stuff like that.  Their family started feeding me psychedelics at the beginning of this, and messing with my head. This continued throughout the next three years. I was 16, freshly emancipated, working 50 hours a week while trying to complete highschool, and pay my rent and other bills, living with this partner.  I dropped out, and spiraled, bad, over the next three years. My mental health deteriorated, I was cut off from friends and family if they didn't serve him and his motives, I was told I was stealing his friends, etc. By the end of our time together I was not able to function, in any sense.  From the beginning I had to buy their affection. If we went out, I paid for the meal, and gas, they would barely talk to me, spend time on their phone, etc. This was the foundation of the entire relationship.  I was encouraged, not to progress in life-but the manipulation was so, so, so, smooth, that I didn't understand. There were many thoughts I had, that seemed organic, but we're actually put into my head (I'm not sure if this makes sense. I'll try to describe it better if it doesn't).  I wasn't allowed to go places without them, but they didn't enjoy going out. This eventually translated into me not being allowed to have a job, but being scum for sitting at home all day, or being scum for working all the time and not spending time with them.  If we fought he would disconnect the internet, cut off the service to my phone so I couldn't contact anyone, wait until I had a panic attack and would crawl back to them in the bedroom.  I suffered a severe injury and couldn't walk for over a month, and they refused to help, with the dog, with the apartment, food, anything.  They would encourage my binge eating, fasting, and other self destructive behaviors.   They also has issues with chronic masturbation and objectification. I was not aware of the chronic masturbation until the last 3 months of our relationship. We were together 3 years, I don't understand how they hid it.  This brings me to my original point of posting: the objectification, has really messed me up mentally. When we would sleep at night, they would hold me sososo tight, I couldn't breathe. I would wake up multiple times having to readjust so I could. It disfigured my left breast, because we would sleep in the same position, every night, and their hand would be there, holding me, that tightly. I know it sounds wacky, but it's true.  I suffered from a lot of sexual abuse as a child, and it took me years to overcome that and love my body. Now it's literally disfigured. I know it doesn't matter to others, that the guys I'm with probably won't notice or care, but I do, and I feel fucking disgusting, my skin is constantly crawling, and I feel like every sense of myself that I had has been torn away. I'm looking into a breast augmentation.  The verbal abuse was really bad. They told me they wished I would get raped again, I should kill myself, no one was going to want me, I was gross, disgusting, that I had to much body hair (even though I shaved regularly), ew, told me I made them want to kill themselves, etc.  When we would have sex they would restrict my movements, and whatnot, so they could finish. Then I was shamed for not doing anything during sex. By 5 months in, I couldn't enjoy it. I started dissociating severely during sex, which has translated into my everyday life. They used BDSM as manipulation.  They never once finger me, or touched me, probably went down on me 5 times in the 3 years we were together. They would tell me I was selfish if I asked.  I started self harming early into the relationship, and they would watch. Towards the end I locked myself in a bathroom, cutting my leg, and called the crisis unit. Where I was turned away due to a shortage of beds.  I ended up stopping my birth control so I didn't have to have sex with then.  A month before the end of our relationship, I tried to check myself into a mental hospital. The nurse sent them into the waiting room but I couldn't verbalize that I was being abused. They told me I would have to try to kill myself for admittance.  To me, in the mental state I was in, this was game on, I'll take enough acid to drive myself crazy, and then I'll be away from them for good, because I'll be insane, locked up, and that was better.  We did drugs with their parents, who were extremely sexually suggestive, and messed up in every sense. I took two tabs of acid, and was then offered two more, I was trying to drive myself crazy so I took it, planned on taking more  They refused therapy time and time again and I never understood it. I have a better idea as to why now.   That was interrupted by my then partner, cracking mentally. I identified it before his family did, maybe they were ignoring it, I'm not sure. He picked me up, squeezing me as tightly as he did at night. Calling me ""it"" and ""mine"" looking through me. Their mom told them that they had to let me go, like the cats, dogs, and bunnies, from his childhood, and if I loved them I'd go back to them. That's literally a psychopath line from a movie. I'm aware. She was saying it legitimately. I hid behind their stepdad, and then made eye contact with them. They were not looking through me when we made eye contact. They saw me, and proceeded to tackle me to the ground, strangling me, humping me, calling me it and mine, trying to take my clothes off. I started to lose concious and their stepdad ripped them off me, to my surprise. The rest of the night was strange. It was like they had a protocol for what happened.  I'm just so lost. I'm so lost and I don't know what to do. I know I shouldn't feel the way I do, but I still feel this way, I constantly feel like I'm pushing myself too much or too little, I physically cannot cry, even though I want to. I have little to no support system and I feel uncomfortable trying to make new connections due to all this. There's not good domestic violence resources in my area, and I'm not sure if that's the proper resource to reach out to.  I really just need some support and to connect with someone-on any aspect of this. I know this was an extremely long post, I'm sorry, thank you for taking the time to read it if you did."
physical,Trying to heal,"I got out of an abusive relationship about a year ago. I know it__ been awhile but I still feel so raw sometimes. Im only 19 and I__e been abused by 2 men since the age of 15. The first one sexually assaulted me multiple times and emotionally abused me over the course of. The second lured me into a false sense of security by being sweet and caring about my past and then revealed just how terrible he was by raping me multiple times, gaslighting, some physical abuse, emotional and mental abuse over the course of 3 years. And as much as I hate to say it some of the abuse he programmed me with is still there even tho he hurt me beyond repair and I hate him more than anything there are moments of weakness where I feel like it would be easier to go back to it than do something unfamiliar because even though he hurt me he was familiar and he made me believe he was my only comfort.I want to talk about it and heal from it but I can__ I tried to tell someone who I believed was my best friend about the first guy and she showed me how little she cared. I don__ know what to do, I can__ go a second without it haunting me and it feels like sometimes it controls me more than I do. I__e been trying to get help but the most I can get is therapy once a month. Sometimes what I feel is so intense that I wish I would just fall of the face of the earth. I__ tired of being a victim instead of a survivor and I wish I could find the help I need. Please help I don__ have anyone else to turn to I can__ tell my family. Thanks for listening."
physical,Parole time comes this Halloween and my story,"I got the call tonight that my abusive ex is being let out on parole this Halloween along with many other prisoners. The parole officer said something about ""they want them all out early"" and even he sounded distraught. The news was expected someday but it still made my cry loudly.  I've been very sad lately because I watched my mom die slowly, then quickly to cancer last Nov. In these times, I really need my mom, but she's gone not of her own will. She would've hugged me and honestly probably cried with me.  I told my husband and he didn't respond. Then he avoided me. I feel worse having him avoid me than if I was completely alone in those moments so I wanted a hug or anything really. I expressed these thoughts to him and it started an argument where he said I'm constantly bringing my sadness down on him. I try not to say negative things because of this but I feel some things *should* be ok to discuss. I just want support in the form of a hug or ""that's crazy"", anything but avoidance.  He said thinking about my ex makes him ""win"" but I strongly disagree. I don't think pushing down my emotions would be considered winning either. He also said something about how it was ten years ago. That's true, but I was almost murdered and only survived because I looked bloody and dead but was just passed out. I'm not sure that there is an expiration date on trauma. He thinks I have an attachment to him but that thought made me actually feel like throwing up because I hate my ex so much. I just can't stand the idea that he's out there alive, ready to hurt his next victim. It's wrong. My husband is my best friend in all other aspects, I don't think he was shown a healthy way to handle emotions. I go to therapy but he doesn't. I think he should.  I also worry about my stepdad who still lives in the same house my ex knew me to live in. I'm worried about my dogs that live there. I'm worried about my husband's parents at their known house. I'm worried it's going to come to a fight to the death between us again.  If you'll let me, I have a desire to tell my story but because I'm attached, but because it's cathartic and I want the thoughts out. Am I wrong that it still makes me cry? It makes me miss my mom.  Almost a decade ago I was dating a controlling, jealous, and mean-spirited human. It started after a date when he made us ""fb official"" and I felt too awkward to say ""no? Wtf too soon and you didn't ask"" He had tried some attempts to control me but I generally stood my ground against those attempts (tracking app being one I instantly shut down). I was young and not knowledgeable about red flags at 19. I knew about kidnappers and serial killers, but this? This is new and not black and white.  We dated for 2 years and I had finally had enough of his controlling attempts when one of my best friends messaged me saying he had tried to get her to change the location of our next hangout because she wanted to show me the architecture of a club (we are NOT clubbers). He said guys will want to dance up on me (like I'd even dance). That was the last straw. Try to control me, fine, but leave my friends alone. I immediately confronted him as I was living with him. I was done, I broke up with him. I started walking back to my car at the nearby college when he offered a ride.....  Never accept the ride.  I got in and he took off. He started yelling at me saying untrue things like how I supposedly said I would marry him (I specifically remember constantly thinking I'd never marry him). We pass the college. I try to jump out of the car while he blows through a red light turning left. He was holding onto my pants belt loop as I was screaming part way out of the car. He parked behind a grocery store on the truck loading ramp that slopes down out of view.  I exhaled then was grabbed by the neck and pushed in between the two front seats into the back. I was upside down, my legs still in the passenger seat, head in the back, his weight on top whole he strangled me for minutes. Yellow foam came out of my mouth. I was only exhaling. The most intense pain unlike anything I can describe except ""like lava poured into the brain"". I was so scared, this was it, I'd never see my mom again. Images flipped past my mind's eye like a flipbook but too fast to comprehend. Regret. Regret. Mom.  I came back to. I had passed out. My face was covered in blood from my nose. My eyes were filled with blood. My face was filled with blood inside my skin. ""I'm going to die"" I repeated until he let go and I was able to go outside the car. He looked scared instead of angry now. He thought I died and was scared for himself. Said he would've dumped me in the ocean (dumbass). A man in a car was watching with his mouth agape but didn't offer help. I left in that car again, I shut down, pretended it didn't happen until eventually he attacked again (never a real attempt again) and neighbors called the cops. I had to get my car towed to my parents because he stole my glasses so the cop wouldn't let me go. I had to tell my parents everything at that point, which leads me to today.  He served 9 years out of 13. I was hoping I would be given the chance to contest his parole like you see in shows, but no. He's back with us this Halloween and he doesn't even need a costume because he's already a monster."
emotional,How am I supposed to feel about my parents?,"I had a bad childhood and I didn't get along with my parents very well a lot of the time. Part of that was my fault and part of that was their fault, but I don't know how much of either. I have autism, so I can be very difficult to deal with (act childish, annoying, selfish). I don't know whether what they did to me would amount to abuse, but they both had bad tempers (still do) and could be bullies. Their first line of attack was usually to verbally berate me__cream, call names, mock, etc. I also have an older brother who around when he was a teenager also developed a temper. He could be near-psychotic growing up, worse than my parents, and it scared the crap out of me. It seemed like he was developing a personality disorder, but my parents ignored it . He seems to be doing ok now__e's a nice person, but his temper still scares me sometimes.   My problem is is that I don't know how to feel about my immediate family. I love them and I know they love me but we fight a lot, especially me with my mom. There are times when I feel resentful for how they treated me growing up and how they treat me now, but then I read long threads of people talking about their parents and stewing over things they did and slinging blame and I just feel sick. I find it hard to blame them. They both had hard childhoods and seem like naturally unhappy people. I can understand that when you get as angry as they often did and do it can be hard to control yourself__ot making excuses  Why does everything have to be this never-ending cycle of bitterness and blame and resentment? I want to just forgive them and move on. (I'm 22 now.) But they're still hard to live with, and being around them makes me unhappy a lot of the time. They all still have bad tempers, and it just puts me on edge. What the hell am I supposed to do?"
emotional,Still have bad dreams,"I had a bad dream last night that he found a way to contact me and roped me back into the relationship, and then berated me for days for talking to people that weren__ him while we were apart. We__e been split and haven__ spoken for over 2 months now and still the anxiety that I felt when I woke up was intense_ I__ glad it__ over between us and I hope I never end up in a relationship like that again. It__ really crazy how the things they do and say can stick with you forever. I still feel like I__ walking on eggshells even when I talk to new people, I just expect them to turn out the same. It__ hard! I hope everyone is doing well!"
physical,Extreme Severe Trauma Attack First time,"I had a very very severe case of trauma panic attack because of Domestic Violence, my mom put a knife sort of sharp object pushed me to the wall when I was injured and couldn't have escaped. I screamed on the top of my lungs for help. My body was shaking uncontrobally. Without the help of my cousins, my other family members assisting me to calm me down I would certainly have had a very rough time. At the same I was already suffering from anxiety and being stuck in my room 24 hrs a day because of quarantine. I was afraid, I didn't know what was happening to me, as of even right now my hands are still shaking uncontrobally as it just happened 10 minutes ago or so. My intention for writing this is to  calm my nerves and at the same time seek help and document what I am right now feeling. I'm 16 years old and for the first time of my life this is the first time I've experienced such a very severe case of trauma. My stomach was empty during all of this, I have a cast on my left hand after fracturing my 4th metacarpal bone and at the same day I had my worst panic trauma whatever attack which is today I had an accident stubbing my toe. My movement was deprived due to this meaning that when domestic violence was put up against me it took 100% of my will power to grab my mom's wrist and scream at the top of my lungs and run down the stairs. My family thought it was a fire but it was domestic violence. We had an argument or more of like a tantrum of me when I got my injury I would like to admit that as a 16 year old and of conscience i was in a state of rational thinking wait this isn't right I shouldn't be doing this I'll fix my room etc. I got hugged against the wall with a knife/sharp object very close to my throat. I was scared, cold, clueless when my severe trauma attacked. The uncontrollable shaking lasted for hours before it gradually slowly got better all thanks to my kind and loving cousins. But during that time including my nasal polyps makes it hard to breathe I was very sure I might pass out and I was unable to move due to the shaking of my body. Even with deep breaths it took a while for me to be in control. It seemed that eating food was the most important of all. Eating food calmed me down most likely because I'm hungry.

emotional,Mom here wanting to be a better parent,"I have a 4.5 year old daughter who has anxiety and sensory processing disorder when it comes to clothes.  When I was her age I had anxiety and SPD with food. My mom was a yeller my dad was too and they both would physically discipline myself and brothers but my dad was more abusive. He would also be verbal and emotionally abusive, tell me as a teen no one would ever want to be with me, call me stupid etc.  Now with my daughter pre covid it was difficult morning with getting her dressed and out the door so I could get to work and as im going to be late for work I would yell, and I would apologize after. I dont call her names, I don't hit her. If anything I take her to a pediatric behavioral psychologist and occupational therapy to assist me with her.  Now since we have been home for a year with me working and her home with me (my husband works crazy hours), I find myself yelling more. Kids with SPD also have discipline issues, she is super smart but doesn't listen at all, which is frustrating when I'm in a meeting or call or in the middle of something.  I dont want to yell at her. I don't want my yelling or threatening to take something away to stunt her in any way.  Any books, advice on how to stop the cycle?"
emotional,My mother,I have a question. My little brother said he hated himself and my mother threatened to take away his phone and internet. She has done a lot of things to me and my siblings to the point where I think I would crash Reddit if I wrote them all. Some times she would get physical. One time at the age of 11 she held me by my hair and hit me with a rubber spatula. Another time my brother broke his desk and yelled at him for crying. She told him she is going to pay for the damages with his bank account. He has been saving up for awhile. The desk is 15 years old and has had a big crack in it for ages. Is this emotional abuse? I have been experiencing it for almost a decade.
physical,Abusive brother harassing sister and mother. They have nowhere to go. He owns the family house. I live 7 hours away. What can I do? (Canada),"I have an abusive older brother (in his early 30s) and a younger sister (in her late 20s). My mom is 72.  They live with my mom in the home we grew up in, that my dad purchased. My dad (and mom, under duress) transferred ownership of the home to my older brother years ago and then my dad left the country (he doesn't give a shit). My mom doesn't speak the language here, is type 1 diabetic, and is 72 years old. Collects old age security and has nothing to her name.  My brother has been a problem our entire lives. He has a temper, is violent, verbally abusive and is extremely narcissistic. I haven't been on speaking terms with him since I was a teenager. He's done some really bad shit to the family, specially my sister and my mom. Today, he threw my sister on the floor a bunch of times, his first act of physical violence in a couple of years. Usually it's all just verbal abuse, threats, manipulation and harassment to the edge of physical violence or restraint (he knows the legal limits he can fuck around with). But the abuse is there. It's always been there.  What options do I have for my family? How can I get them out? I can tell my sister to get a restraining order but he owns the house she lives in. What legal action, if any, can we take against my brother?   I know my sister can maybe stay with friends for a bit and look for a job. But what about my mom? My mom doesn't quite understand the situation she is living under and the abuse she receives. But the rest of us know that a man in his 30s constantly yelling at a helpless senior citizen IS NOT OK.  What recourse do I have???"

emotional,Sad and disappointed,"I have been dealing with my difficult mother for most of my life. My brother and I lived with her since my dad divorced when we were young. My mom has always had fierce mood swings and would yell and cry at seemingly small issues on a regular basis. We never got in trouble at school and rarely did anything malicious to provoke her, but we would always end up getting screamed at. I believe alcohol had something to do with it, but it always seemed like her mood could switch on a dime. Things were always verbal, as she never tried to physically harm us. It always seemed to be just on the verge of what was acceptable. Not that screaming at your kids is morally right, just it's not illegal I guess. I have bad anxiety and would often discuss my fears and would sometimes tell her that she had triggered an anxious episode. This would anger her and only make things worse. Leaving for college calmed things down, and we would still talk regularly with no apparent problems. Whenever coming home for breaks, though, things would seem to pick right back up or be worse than before. I was blamed for leaving and not wanting to stay home. On my last trip home, things reached a boiling point. We had just gotten home the day before, and she had worked herself up with literally no incitement from us. She began throwing things and yelling and demanding that we leave and go back to school. So we immediately packed up our things and got ready to go before she begged us not to leave. It was so infuriating because I knew she was trying to manipulate my brother and me. We took a walk to let her cool down and decided to leave the next day after getting some sleep. She said that was fine. So we left after she went to work the next day. I texted her that we were leaving and she was furious calling over and over and texting countless times that she disowns me and that she hopes we crash and die. I'm so sad because I spent so much time having hope that she would get the help she needs, but it seems like it will never happen. I am planning to never go back and just stay at my school apartment until I graduate and find somewhere else to go. It's hard because our family is small, and I felt like I could count on her to be there, but I think the best thing for her and me is to be apart. It's really sad and a lot to process."
physical,Not sure how to deal with trauma of abuse after my abusers death.,"I have been in several abusive relationships in my life, beginning with my first boyfriend...I guess I'm a product of that phenomenon that once you are in one abusive relationship, they tend to continue to follow you...a depressing thought I think.  But anyhow.  My last relationship was by far the worst.  I loved him so much, I really did.  He was the most fun person when he was not angry.  He could talk for hours and I could tell him anything.  But he was also abusive.  I knew he was, I told him he was, but I told no one else.  I was so embarrassed to be in the relationship.  When I would try to break up with him, he would blackmail me with nude photos and videos of us having sex that he had taken without my consent.  He had had an accident and had a plate in his head.  I think it affected his impulse control and temper, because he truly did have the biggest heart.  It started with him getting blackout drunk and beginning to rape me.  When I said no and tried to push him off, he said ""I thought you liked being raped"" referring to how an ex had raped me after we broke up and I forgave him.  I never said I ""liked"" it.  It was traumatizing.  It just got worse and worse.  I stand up for myself and fight back...I have a strong personality.  He could not take it.  If I said the wrong thing at the wrong time, he would turn into a different person.  He would drive 50 miles over the speed limit while screaming at me, call me every name in the book, throw things at me, hit me, get on top of me with his knee on my throat.  He'd hit me with objects, ""slap"" me in the face (which left bruises), punch me in the elbow and not let me go get it checked out at the ER...I could not move it for a few days...pour water on me, sling me around all over the place...into things, onto the floor, yell in my face so close he was spitting on me, calling me every name in the book.  Anytime I tried to break up with him, he wouldn't let me.  When I tried to get him to leave my house, he refused.  I was always covered in bruises.  I began documenting the abuse with a journal and pictures on a flashdrive at work and told an ex about the flash drive in case anything ever happened to me.  The night he first hit me in the face (at least twice, along with my head), he finally let me break up with him.  I think it scared him how crazy he had gotten although later he claimed that I abused him too so we were both abusive (just because I fought back instead of just letting him beat me up).  After the abuse, he forced me to have sex with him and I told him he was raping me and he mocked me for it.   I was so happy to be rid of him but two nights later, he talked me into talking to him and we ended up having sex again (consensual).  Why I don't know...I guess I fell for his apologizes, although I told him we were never getting back together.  The next morning I took a pregnancy test.  It was positive.  Feeling stuck, I agreed to marry him.  We planned a fast wedding and at first he was so nice to me.  A couple weeks before the wedding, however, the abuse started back.  Even though I was pregnant, he still hit me in the face, threw me onto the floor, etc.  I told him I wasn't marrying him and he said I had to or he would share the photos and videos to people we knew and porn sites.  I told him that was revenge porn and an offense and he said he had checked and it wasn't a crime where we live (he was correct).   I told him marrying him was a death sentence.  I firmly believed that.  A few days before the wedding, I found out he did something pretty horrible (it ended up not being as bad as we initially thought but still bad).  I called off the wedding.  Since it was so bad and people were finding out what happened, he left me alone.  Finally I did talk to him about a week later.  I did still love him but I told him I didn't know how we could be together with what all he had done to me and the other things that he had done in the past to others.  Later that day, he was found no longer alive.  I have really struggled with the grief of losing him, because I did love him, and also anger at him for what he put me through and also for leaving me pregnant and alone.  I want him here, and I am also glad he is gone because I know the abuse would have continued.  I suspect at the rate it was escalating that I would have ended up dead eventually.  I guess it was better him than me, but still I do miss him.  It is such a mix of emotions that is hard to understand and process.  I want to just look at him in a good way because of our child.  I want her to only know the good of her dad, and there was a lot of good.  I don't want her to know that lived every day with bruises, that I still had a black eye (thank goodness for makeup) when we got engaged, or that the only reason I agreed to marry him was for her.  I don't want for her to know that I lived in fear.  I don't want her to know that the longest recording I have of her dad's voice was when he was angry at me from saying one word the wrong way (not even a cuss or ugly word) and it turned into him being abusive and saying horrible things to me and then refusing to let me break up with him.  I am happy she didn't get to see that side, but also I'm sad that she didn't see the great side either.  I am angry and relived about his death.  I feel alone and wish I could talk to him, but I'm also glad that I no longer live in fear.  I want him to experience this pregnancy with me, but I'm also so happy that my skin is no longer black and blue.  It's just a lot to process.  Anyway, I guess I just needed to get my feelings out.  I don't share them with anyone...I just focus on the good of him as that is what I want to keep alive.  So, instead, all of those horrible memories just stay in my head to surface at anytime.    He's my child's father and he's dead.  I don't want to hate him.  I don't want to be angry with him.  How can I forget?"
physical,Figuring out how to live with my PTSD,"I have been struggling with suicidal ideation as a result of 7 years of physical and mental abuse. I have been free of my abusive ex partner for 3 years now and have spent that time just trying to be okay.  I know that he is happy with his new partner. I have him blocked but he has called on *69 and let me know that. I feel mentally sick almost everyday so I exercise and try to keep my mind occupied. I struggle so much with addiction and I have developed a mental addiction to alcohol now too.  I am a 27 year old female living with my parents in my hometown, I have no job due to Covid, and I can__ figure out what to do with my life knowing this dark past of mine is my greatest weakness and makes me inconsistent in a lot of ways. I struggle with emptiness and giving up every single second of everyday, and the only things that seem to help are when I clear my mind. I have improved a lot in the past 3 years.   But I feel so empty and alone. My depression hasn__ been helped by talk therapy, medication (yes I__e done that), and exercise only helps for a few hours. I feel that nothing will ever change and I__l be stuck like this forever until I eventually give up entirely. I am not actively suicidal, my parents and entire family are intimately aware of my struggles, and I manage. I am just far from thriving. I feel hopeless that I__l ever be viewed as a valuable candidate for any professional jobs because this is who I am. Ugh."
physical,domestic violence with mental illness,"I have been though it, I was in love with a man who happen to had a mental illness that of course I did not know about till we were in it for over 3 years. Fast forward to 2019 when he stopped taking his medication because an online friend told him that mental illness did not exist. So I woke up on 01/15/2019 to him squeezing my face and crying and telling me to not forget him and to read his twitter and tell people of him. He proceeded to attack me, he tried to rape me and murder me and held me hostage. From that day I knew my relationship was over ... I was still in love with him but it was over. Since that day he has stalked me and threated to kill me, put my information on social media for others to stalk me and murder me. I had a no contact order that was issued in 01/2019, it was extended till Sept 2021 because he hurt other people but I could never get anyone in law enforcement in  4 states to violate him. I have over 3000+ violations and no one cares. I am in jail, I have to hide, he not only hurt me physically, but he silenced my voice and killed my will to function as a normal person who can do things without looking over my shoulder. Bonus - every single domestic violence group say they want to help, advertise that they are going to help but let me tell you my truth when trying to get help, I do not have kids so I do not matter, I have never received counseling, benefits, reimbursement  nothing. I have been in solidary confinement since 01/15/2019. I am numb, I have nightmares every night, I sleep with the lights on, I am alone, I can not meet people. So what do I do ? when no one will make him stop calling me, Bonus he is homeless in L.A, he thinks that he is married to Paris Hilton, he thinks that he is FBI and my phone number is the only number that he remembers and yes I block every number that he calls from. Who can actually help me ?"
physical,Domestic abuse and sexual trauma,"I have been with my boyfriend for a little over a year. There__ issues with his mom. She sexually abused him and still tried to while I was with him. I didn__ like this and it triggered me because she would watch us be intimate and would ask me to remove my blanket and I have been assaulted so this really triggered me. When we moved in together I would see his mom send inappropriate images it made me upset and I told him she__ a molester and a creep stop talking to her. He would get mad and physically abuse me. When we have fights about anything or me confronting him it turns into him being physical with me. Last night I went on his phone and I saw his messages with his friend. He was telling his friend that he gets aggressive with me. His friend was calling me a crazy bitch and that I deserved to be slapped around and he responded by saying lol as if him physically abusing me is a joke. I woke up my boyfriend and was telling him how this is messed up. He started choking me squeezing and pinching my face and my body, throwing me around telling me his friend is right and that I deserved to be beaten. He also spit on me and sprayed water on me. He told me he was going to kill me and rape me. He started touching  and scratching me aggressively while kissing me and I was crying. He didn__ rape me or kill me but why would he tell me that. I__ so sad and upset. He tells me that I deserve this and that I__ evil for saying things about him mom."
physical,Got strangled by partner for the first time,"I have been with my partner for 2 years and there have been times when he gets angry for menial things but snaps out of it to apologise. We__e always fooling around teasing each other and that bond has grown closer since we__e moved in and been in lockdown for the past few weeks. We were in bed just teasing each other today and I tickled him, he moved his head and my finger accidentally hit his lips. I stopped to see what happened but he started strangling me. I pushed him away after a few secs and he let go, I got mad at him and asked if it was okay to strangle someone when accidents happen when you__e fooling around. He didn__ say anything, looked at me angrily and turned away. After some time he went to start dinner and then came into the room to apologise. He said I should apologise to him too for what I did to his lip and that I never apologise even when it__ my mistake and continued on to say that his lip really hurt which made him strangle me. I just kept to myself and he tried to kiss me, I forced him away. He walked away saying he wouldn__ speak to me even if I came to talk to him later. My neck hurt for quite a while and I still feel a lump in my throat. I don__ know what to do and if this is a sign of physical violence."
emotional,I don__ know if my relationship is salvageable or if I even want to try,"I have been with my SO for 4 years, married for 1.5. Looking back, there were so many red flags I should have seen from the beginning, but I came from a strict background and was naive and he seemed so fun and exciting. I didn__ know my worth. Slowly things escalated and he started gaslighting me constantly, making critical remarks towards pretty much everything, having unrealistic expectations of sex, and not allowing me to get mental health treatment. Several years later I__e finally started therapy on my own regardless of the repercussions. It got to a breaking point where I left and suddenly things are so much better. He__ acknowledging everything he did wrong and how we can fix it, going to couples therapy (something he promised when we got married and then bailed), and individual therapy after ending up in the ER for threatening suicide when I left. I feel so lost. Things genuinely are better but my mindset is the same. I__ so far gone I don__ know if I will ever come back. I ended up sleeping with someone else when I left out of anger because he told me he thought he should sleep with other people since I can__ have sex with him enough and that__ so not like me to do, I was just so hurt and felt so unwanted. Now he__ doing everything right but I still feel nothing. Any advice?"

emotional,"I can't shake off this feeling, that i made a mistake? Long long post.","I have gone through lot of subs here, several posts to rationalise what has happend over 1.5 year. I am M27 and ex F20, we met online, has been LDR ever since, initially it started off as friendship and after a year of this she confessed that she has feelings for me. Things started off pretty good, we had fun, but few things bothered me right from the start. her ex,who she broke off with,was constantly trying to get her back which got me genuinely uncomfortable, told her to cut all communication off,which later turned out that she was talking to him behind my back. She apologised and promised to not to do it again. Which never really happend period, There were lot of rough patches,yet managed to balance out. Then came this never ending fights, To illustrate an example  SHE: hey,  remember my friend  zzzz? she's with a new                         bf,  again! damn she's having time of her life. ME: umm, what do you mean by time of her life? SHE: she's going to new places doing new stuff every       other day. That's fun. ME: ah! Cool. SHE: Ya know all the guys she has been with prior, turned out to be cheaters hurt her bad. ME: yeah? maybe, she needs to take it slow before getting into another relationship, cause she seems to be making wrong choices, seeing her past once turned out to be cheaters. SHE:  what's wrong with getting into new relationship after a breakup? ME: nothing wrong with it, seems like she's making wrong choices, relationship wise. SHE' (in elevated voice ) are you calling her a playgirl? You know she's my close friend?  Stop having shuch old peoples mentality. People are allowed to have as many partners they want. Your thoughts a gross and disgusting! ME:no i didn't mean that, (now i am annoyed and Frankly hurt )  well, i mean she's also at fault for making poor choices. I mean if she's having platonic relationship, it'd be ok but branding them as ""boyfriends"" is little ridiculous if she's changing them every often if that's the case, she's a playgirl, if same done by a guy he'll be called a playboy doesn't he?  SHE: whatever, your thoughts are closed and worst. Now i lose my cool, and tell her to stop this, SHE: awwww are you jealous that you didn't get as many girlfriends? After this we end up having huge fight,  I have observed that, whenever there were fights, She'd ""get on my nerve"" I am kind of the person who prefers finding a common ground but she wanted to deal with it then and there. Which frankly was out of my reach, and to get space i used to block her. This was my way of getting my space. The next morning she'd be still angry about it and point out my mistakes and make me feel even more terrible about all this. This cycle of  fight -block-beg back. Continued, she started to go to online sites where she says she would share her ordeal with guys who'd comfort her etc etc. This went on for a very long time and i broke up with her. Anyone give their two cents on this."
emotional,I want her back even if she hurts me,"I have grown comfortable being emotionally detached from reality, I tried to love her no matter the pain I was in, but the pain eventually traumatized me. Now I want her back so bad, I__ ready for round 3, but it won__ happen. I couldn__ win the first two times. I don__ care if she __anipulated_ me into believing that everything I wanted was wrong. I molded into what it felt like she wanted. It was excruciatingly painful but I did it, even though it ultimately made me push her away. There__ nothing that I want anymore except her approval. Idgaf what that makes me, or how pathetic my past-self would think of this. Self-care and self-love can shove it. Thanks for coming to my ted talk. Hope you__e all doing relatively well considering you__e on this sub."
emotional,Rant,"I have left some pretty toxic friendships. I stopped doing ballet to get away from the people that made me hate myself. It's been almost 2 years but I can't seem to get over what I've been through. I feel used and worthless. From 12, when I realised the abusive patterns,all the way to 16, I was living in hell. Remember me when I was crying because your friend's mom yelled at me in front of people that I stole you from her daughter? I was fucking 12, crying and you didn't even hug me. Remember when I walked for 30 minutes in the rain to bring you sanitary fucking pads? Yeah. And then I walked back another 30 minutes. And when they made fun of me in ballet class, you just stood there. And listened. Probably laughed as well. You pos. You are just a year older than me yet I feel like I was the mature one in this friendship. Go fuck yourself with all due respect. I did everything I could and you did nothing. Not that I ever asked you for anything, but when you saw with your own eyes that I needed to be supported, to talk, you weren't there.  I hope yall are able to leave abusers no matter what the relationship you have with them is. It's hard and I am willing to talk it through with anyone who needs it. Sorry for the rant, I needed to get this out of me. Have a nice day."
emotional,Perhaps I was a victim of abuse and can this be the reason why I have an anger towards this world?,"I have not talked about this with anyone, but yet here I am speaking my mind about my goals, views, thoughts, and my own trauma. I am 34 years old, some will label me successful, but I feel I am far from that. I will get to that later. I am here because, I feel like I need to just tell someone my thoughts, my mind, my goals in life that is possibly driven by my past.  My past. I was a kid, I remember it very vividly. Emotional and physical abused by my own parents (except my mother) and strangers. One thing comes to mind F\*\*K them all. I have become so cold that I dont care if they die. My step brother at time time was gay, nothing wrong with that, in fact I support them. I am straight myself, however my step mother told me I was the reason he turned out like that and perhaps I was the gay one, that I like men when I was a kid. And so what if I did turn out that way? If I had a son who turned gay, I would not care. But I think its just the blame game.  Emotional abuse? I remember very well my father said was I stupid when I was growing up if I did something wrong. From martial arts to dropping something like an item by mistake. Some reason I was always some kind of disappointment, but at the same time he did mention once in a while how proud he was of me, maybe it was not that bad. But a quick definition of my life, constantly by strangers, step fathers and other I was constantly told how stupid I was, that I would amount to anything, that I will never be a man, that I will never succeed. Even my sister to my sisters husband, I was still living at home at 25 or 26, still trying to figure out life. was going to school at the time, and I remember them telling me I am grown man, I need to figure out life and I need to grow up. I didnt understand, I was in school pursuing my engineering degree. There was a lot more, but just too much to type but you can imagine...a big wtf.  Ive had complete strangers come up to tell me I would never amount to anything, I have no idea why. I remember I was working as a waiter setting up some tables and some RANDOM person came up to me and told me, I wont even last 3 months in that place; never made sense to it. Another incident was some local man from my neighborhood literally came to my face and told me I will never be a man, never will be anything in life, I was about 14 then. My step Father told my mother that I was stupid and had no common sense. Step father and I got into an argument and was then forced to live with my father since my mother wanted to still live with him. Father and I went at it also because I just wanted to skateboard with my neighborhood friends and wanted me back by 7. I kind of rebelled. 20 years later, I still dont understand why. He locked me outside one time and I stood out all night by myself as a kid. Forward a few months later, I got into a fist fight with my father...long story short friends came to my house because they threw something at one of neighbors and I had no idea. I was just at home minding my own business. father came home from work and next thing you know it, I was the blame. we fought and went to prison. Not the first time ive been arrested bc of my ""fake"" friends. Again too much to type, so I cant really discuss everything. Of course, there was always good. my father did care for me, bought me stuff so I guess I cant be that bad. I had a clean home, still had a father. But stuff like my own grandmother telling me I will be in prison and in a gang at the age of 16. Anyways, I was hit when I was a kid, not very often but when it happened, it seemed like my father had a kick out of it from how long it lasted. I think it was overboard looking back at it. WHY THE F\*\*K WOULD YOU EVEN HIT A CHILD FOR DOING SOMETHING SO MILD. The amount of people that hit their children often, WTF. Why. I am 34 now and I still dont see the sense of it. To me its stupid and almost seems the parents enjoy physically harming someone where they are defenseless. DO THAT TO ME NOW and see what happens. Go abuse a 30 a year old, why dont you?  &amp;#x200B;  one instance I remember. I was in TX for vacation with my father. I was a teen at the time. I was almost abducted. 4 men in a very old car stopped very close to me and all watched me. I knew it was not good. they were getting ready to open the door while all staring at me. I was left alone skating bc my dad allowed me but got back late while I was waiting for him. anyways he approached at the right time and they took off incredibly fast. perhaps he saved my life.  My views of the world: I am 34 now, I make 6 figures now, and many label me very successful, but I feel like I am not. I am so success driven and its all I think about. I invest a ton of money in the stock market as well just to get more income. I am married and do treat my wife well and part of the reason I want more is to spoil her more. However, all these incidents about how many strangers telling me I wont amount to anything still has me pushing more. I want more success. I am in the middle of opening a company and an affiliate program on top with my job. I am not stressed at all. I have a lot left over to invest, yet alone I have so much down time at my job I can run my spare business. How I got this lucky? Im not sure I know what I have but yet I dont feel satisfied. essentially I just want to glory and a big status to tell my family members and the past strangers a big F-U. So it is not really about the money. My main issue though, is I am very aggressive with people unless I know them, then I am incredibly warm hearted and nice. If you open a conversation I am very nice and respectful. However to a complete stranger I have a bunch of hate towards them. I dont think there is any good in this world and god know how many abusive people are in this world vs actual good ones. I feel like 8 out of 10 people are evil in my mind, because almost everyone I have met as a child turned out to be that way. Even my own step brother. The crazy thing is, I think about this very often, all these thing strangers told me and even my own family. Like WTF why in the hell would you tell some 20 yr old who is college for engineering, working, and trying to figure out my life. I need to grow up. I need to do something with my life. F\*\*K YOU.  I was also bullied as a kid often. Now I am a pretty large guy at 230lbs heavy lifter, active. I feel like everyone is a bully one way or another and I am pretty aggressive towards other people who are ill mannered. I hate it though, I get upset, angry and even get headaches. Its just a small list of things I think about though. either way, enjoy. Im not sure what to think tbh, perhaps this is child play compared to others for sure. So I have to still be thankful. But why is something so minor compared to other people effecting me so much. this must be childs play in comparison?"
emotional,"In relationships, withholding affection and the silent treatment are the worst of them all.","I have spent several months pouring my heart and soul into someone while being sober for the first time pretty much ever. Things were always great; aside from the name calling, and constant belittling, trying to prove anything i say wrong, talking about my dead mother, talking about exes. and this was just the beginning. 5 months later, a new friend has re-entered my SOs life and everything is changing. this was a friend my SO used to pay for everything for, and now things are different. I caught SO in a lie, proved it by going through their phone, and then a total melt down proceeded to happen and first we needed a week break, now i need a job to talk to my SO (her words) My part in this was my own jealousy and insecurities and attempting to control her time, which i will fix."
physical,"I called the police on a possible domestic abuse situation, and I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do","I heard a woman yelling for help outside my apartment. I looked outside and saw a man attacking a woman in a car. I opened my window and yelled at them to pull over (they were still sort of rolling down the street), mostly because I wanted the woman to know someone was hearing her. I called 911 but as I was on the phone they drove away.  I don't know if this was the right thing to do. I did some research afterward and am learning that getting the police involved can sometimes escalate DV situations. Was calling 911 the right response? If not, how can I respond better in the future?  For context, from what I could see it looked like both of these people were white, which I think is important if we're considering the risk of *police* violence in response to this."
physical,Survivors Guilt?,"I hope this is the right subreddit. I__ still trying to process and find words to my emotional experience recently:  In light of the mass response to Gabby Petitos murder, and with so many people connecting her as a victim of domestic violence, I__e had a very difficult week. I have been out of the relationship I was abused in for almost six years, and feel so triggered by all of this visibility, even though it is so necessary.   Does anybody else experience survivors guilt? How do you handle these complex feelings?"
emotional,Feeling confused and depressed after being emotionally abused,I just ended a relationship because any time my ex and I would have a disagreement he would never have a conversation about it to my face but when he would leave my place or I left his that__ when he would text me hurtful things. He would tell me really hurtful things that he knew would hurt my soul. Then I would apologize because he would somehow manipulate me into thinking I did something wrong for wanting to communicate when something bothered me.  The crazy thing is is that in person he was so sweet to me but when we fought and he was away just texting me hurtful shit it felt like a stranger. I__ confused because he never emotionally abused me in person but only through text and it somehow distorted my view of what I thought emotional abuse was because I thought it just happened face to face. When I tried to explain the reason why I was breaking up and even apologizing for the things I could of done better thinking that maybe he would admits his faults he didn__ . He didn__ acknowledge how his words hurt me and he didn__ apologize. Now I feel empty and drained . I know people have had it worst but this whole situation has confused my perception of emotional abuse and if I even really experienced it . I guess I just need advice on what did I experience and are my feelings really valid ?
physical,I finally blocked him...but I can__ stop thinking about it,"I just ended a six year relationship with a guy who I thought was my best friend and soul mate. I have not talked to him in three months but the realizations of the impact he has had on my self-esteem, ability to trust, and my perception of reality is overwhelming to say the least.   I have endured several traumatic experiences over the past two years outside of this relationship, and I always came back to him as a source of comfort. Comfort is an odd word to use because he never provided me support, but his constant criticism and ability to make me feel worthless with no effort was familiar to me. He would call me worthless, desperate, unattractive, overweight, awkward, and stupid. He would bully me in front of other people. He would constantly tell me he wanted to hook up with my friends. He would demand that I pleasure him sexually at his convenience, never mine. During sexual encounters, in my most vulnerable state, he would tell me I would never be good enough to be loved by him, and that all the other girls in his life were more attractive and better in bed than I was. He would tell me my friends did not want to be around me and that I was forcing my presence on them. When I would start to pull away, he would tell me he loved me more than anyone else in the world, that we are soulmates, that he wants me in his life forever. He would promise he would change. He never did. He was aggressive and would overpower me physically, punching me, shoving me, hitting me, and then saying that I was too sensitive when I said I didn__ like it.   Despite this obvious pattern of toxic behavior, I thought I deserved it, and would defend him to those that were genuinely concerned for me. My constant loyalty to him pushed away many of my close friends, as they were frustrated with my inability to listen to reason. I got sober at the end of last year and realized that the relationship wasnt serving my best interest. I had not talked to him in three months and had assumed that I would get over it like any other relationship.   However, I learned from a mutual friend of ours this past week that he has been tarnishing my name to others, framing me as a crazy obsessive girl who is in love with him and wont leave him alone. He has been criticizing my substance abuse issues and saying __ cant handle my alcohol_. Just when I was starting to feel like I was getting over it, reading literature on codependency and working with my therapist on the roots of my codependent tendencies, hearing of the nasty remarks he has been making about me to people who I thought were my friends made me realize all of the treatment that I had endured was not just unacceptable, it was abusive in nature. I have been diagnosed with PTSD as a result of previous experiences and I have been alternating between dissociative states and immense paranoia and panic for the last few days. It is hard for me to process and I can__ stop thinking about it. When I sleep I dream about it. I don__ know how to make it stop."
physical,Help supporting my sister,"I just found out that a lot of physical stuff that happened to my sister over the years was actually her ex boyfriend hurting her. Like_ really __reak accidents_ and stuff. It__ like rewriting history. I__ very protective of her and I am extremely upset (silently, I__ trying to outwardly be normal for her sake). I__ just so angry at him. They have been broken up for a few years but still share custody of a dog that__ not very old. She still sees him only occasionally because of this. He allegedly hasn__ abused since they broke up but she fears him. I think her hope is once the pet passes he will be gone forever. I think I believe her current assessment of their situation and I know they aren__ together but I think she just doesn__ want to rock the boat and cut him off. I__ just so angry with him I__ crying. I__ so mad. But I don__ want to upset my sister by being upset. I just don__ know how to support her now. What should I do? She rarely sees him but still once in a while because of the pet. He__ dating someone else and has moved to a town a couple hours away. This whole time I just thought they simply didn__ work out. I__ so furious at him but I don__ want to upset my sister. Should I do anything? Say anything?"
emotional,Just need to vent about my drunken ex bf/roommate situation,"I just got called a cunt for not driving his 15 year old daughter to Dairy Queen (3 minute walk and she walks everywhere and he rarely offers to drive her if she wants to walk). He can__ drive her because he__ drunk and has a blow n_ go so that__ why he asked me.  Before this, he asked her if she was hungry and that he would cook her a steak. She said she was, but he needed to wash a pan and plate and wanted her help. She didn__ want to wash the dishes with him, so she said she would walk to Dairy Queen! Then she went into her room to put shoes on and he asked if I would drive her. I__ sitting here painting my nails, with a wet head from the shower. I don__ want to drive and she already said she would walk the 3 minutes. So he calls me a lazy cunt and tells me to shut the fuck up when I try to defend my not wanting to go.  Anytime I don__ do something he wants me to do, I__ awful, I__ a cunt, I__ a bitch, etc. It__ like I have no free will, and if I don__ do what he wants, I__ the world__ shittiest person according to him!   Oh and an hour ago while I was cooking food for myself he called me a selfish bitch and said my ass looked horrible in my jeans so yay :) body shaming, too!!  Only 8 more days of this and I get to move into my own apartment and I hopefully will never see him again. :)"
emotional,I need advice for how to talk to my mom about my ex,"I just got out of a relationship that I realized was abusive, and escalating to where I am worried about my safety. I had to call everyone close to me and let them know I was leaving and not to have contact with him, because I knew he was going to freak out and do everything he could to not let me go. I talked about this more explicitly in my last two posts if anyone needs more context.  My mom literally has the lowest self esteem of anyone I know. I know this is shitty but it pisses me off because she is the example that I had growing up, she never taught me how to have confidence and there were many times she tore down my self esteem in order to make herself feel better. Long story short, we've always had a toxic relationship.  She didn't like my boyfriend at first, because he comes from a different background. But as soon as she saw how happy I was, how charismatic he is (especially when I brought him home to meet my parents), how much he supported me financially and how serious we became, she loved him. Just a few months ago I was telling her that we were looking at apartments, going to move in together as soon as our leases are up, and that we have talked about getting engaged. I even told her about wanting to have kids with him eventually.   On the other hand, she knows about the fights that we would get into, and I would call her in the middle of the night bawling on the phone. She knows the horrible names he would call me, and some of the ways that he would threaten me and guilt trip me when he was upset.   She's not oblivious to his bad behavior, but she's in denial because she her boyfriend is a piece of shit too. They have been on and off a few times, he's cheated on her, told her major lies, and is generally a sleazy person, who covers it up with a friendly, easy going demeanor that I could see right through the first time I ever met him. I told her I didn't like him a while after they started dating, I gave him a fair chance but I just don't have a good feeling about him and I feel like he doesn't respect women. Then, when shit started to go down I told her that he's not going to change, and that I saw this coming and it will probably only get worse. She agreed with me and told me she was done, only to go back to him. When this happened I told her that I love her and ultimately she needs to make her own decisions but I don't like him, I will never think of him as family. I know she is desperate for the attention that he gives her, which is usually concerning how she looks and her image, all superficial things because that's where she finds her worth. I know first hand what it is like to be trauma bonded to someone, so I do empathize with her having such a hard time leaving him.   She has relied on me so much during their relationship, especially when they are on the verge of a 'breakup' and she is blowing up my phone not knowing what to do, so upset about what he is doing. She has asked me for a lot of advice, she even called me when they were talking about moving in together and what she should do. I told her I thought it was a bad idea, but if they do then her name needs to be on the lease so that he does not have financial control if things go south. This is the only advice that she's taken from me. Now they live together, and she is constantly inviting me out to dinner with them or to come hang out at the house, as if I haven't clearly stated that I want nothing to do with him. She even wants me to go on vacation with them, and is upset I don't want to go, and won't stop asking. What pisses me off the most is that she has acknowledged that it is a bad relationship and she told me that ""she deserves whatever is coming to her."" Like, as her daughter it pisses me off that she thinks it's okay to say something like that to me. I'm scared of what's going to happen, and I've tried so hard to help her but it's frustrating to try to deal with my own shit, and to hold her hand at the same time.   When I broke up with my boyfriend this week, he was trying to call everyone, including my work which is when I called the police. My mom was being super overbearing, telling me to call her when I call the police, what did they say, what is bf saying, did the police seem cool about it. I  understand that she is my mom, and has every right to be worried, but I told her that I've thought this through and that she needs to back off because I am very stressed. She got mad at me and said I need to put myself in her shoes. I told her that she needs to have faith in me that I can handle the situation and that I know to ask for help if I need it. Even today she is asking me ""is he still calling you"" and when I told her that I do not want to talk about it she gets mad at me again, says the same thing and that she has to ask one more question ""are you talking to him?"" This made me so fucking upset. Like I feel like hell but I literally never want to see him again so that I don't have to keep going through this. Even though I love him so much.   Her way of comforting me is to tell me that I am going to find a guy that is soooooo much better. I know this seems supportive but to me it feels like she is just fucking tone deaf. I don't know if I will be able to trust or be intimate with someone in the same way ever again. I'm in such a dark place and all I care about is not feeling so fucking crazy all the time and just finding some peace for once in my life. Her solution is you'll be okay, because you'll find attention from a nicer guy. She just sees it as it started out good and didn't work out. She doesn't understand that he is not the person that I thought he was. That everyone still sees him as.    If she is trying to comfort me, or ask me questions it just makes me feel worse because I know she cares but I don't value what she has to say at all and she constantly invalidates my feelings. I just keep telling her that I don't want to talk about it, but she isn't receptive and takes offense to this. It's just adding more stress and bullshit to my life and I don't know how to talk to her about this without being an asshole.   **TLDR: I broke up with my boyfriend and he is trying to manipulate my friends and family. I'm having a hard time and want to move forward and deal with this privately, but my mom won't leave me alone or respect my boundaries when I ask not to talk about it.**"

physical,Panic Attacks Gone,"I just realized I haven__ had a panic attack since leaving my abusive ex husband 3 years ago. I had them every few months our entire relationship of 8 years.   Getting yelled at can really mess with you, don__ underestimate it.   Get safe and live a happier life!"
physical,I don't think I can endure it twice.,"I just really wanted to vent. Kind of like writing a letter and tearing it up. Back in 2017 when I was 17, I fled my parents with nothing to my name and just the clothes I was wearing. They did everything to me from physical to emotional and whatever else I can even think of. I was homeless for a while, found some structure and met someone and rebuilt my life.   It was really hard going from nothing and now I've just found myself in the same pattern. My pretty much now ex (24M) of 5 years of time love and effort has just pushed me to the breaking point where I once again have to up and leave with basically nothing again. At first the relationship was wonderful. We were happy and stable, I found out he used meth a while after but I decided to be naive and think oh it's fine I will be as supportive as I can be and get him through it.  It didn't go that way. Everything eventually devolved, we were both unemployed, he every now and then finding a job only to lose it a few weeks later and me trying to get hired so stress was mounting. His temper started getting short yelling at me more often and about things that are less and less important. Eventually around the 2nd year mark he first struck me. Pulled me from behind and I fell to the floor and I felt something hit my face, eye and nose. I layed there for a while, stood up and just walked out and ignored all the telling and screaming. I got a bunch of calls and texts saying to come back and he was sorry and I believed him so I did. I shouldn't have. It was so dumb of me to do. But I did.   Everything was better for a while but then it just repeated again and again. This goes on for a few more years. His substance abuse gets worse and worse, I go to therapies for my mental health and actually manage to start to get better and even get a job this year which I was so happy about. But that wasn't good enough in my efforts. I would work and he would ask for money and I of course gave it to him only for him to in an outburst yell at me and reveal he didn't use it for bills and instead blew it away. This stressed me out even more because I would put off paying my own bills to support his and every time I started to break down from the overwhelming pressure he would snap with increasing severity each time. Paranoia and mania more and more apparent even to the point of threats of self harm and hurting himself.  A few weeks ago another episode occurred and he slammed a door on me and my fingers got caught. One was broken and I wasn't able to work anymore. I haven't had any income for weeks when I am in desperate need of it and it was getting harder and harder to lie to the people I know. My therapists pressing me about DV more and more and now with the finger i couldn't think of lies or excuses anymore and i just broke down. I just couldn't accept it that the person i love so much is the person that hurts me the most to the point it has a label. I ignored them despite their pleas.  And now? 2 days ago it happened again. I was woken up, punched in the eye and even bitten at 4am with the yelling and screaming that followed and I just had it. I was too scared so I had an appointment later that day and I packed a tiny bag with essentials and left for it and turned my phone off and never went home. They helped me with a few services encouraging me that it was the best thing to do and they were so proud of me for leaving. I got linked with one of the very very few and very congested crisis care services for males because in Australia it's basically non-existent help if you aren't a woman or child.   I've been in a motel for 2 days and tomorrow I'm going to a shelter and I just feel like I can't cope with doing this again. Its worse because I love him more than anything else and it rips me apart. I didn't even feel this much loss leaving my parents the first time. I feel lost and alone, I don't have friends or family to fall on or to talk to. Its just me. Alone. In a city I don't even know now with so much pent up anxiety I feel like I'm going to have a stroke. I don't know what I did wrong. What I didn't help with properly. Of course he wasn't always the one to start an argument because that's what happens sometimes in a couple right? Disagreements come and go. But I can't think of what i did for this to happen and not having a reason makes me feel so torn.  Anyway, sorry for this long and annoying post. I'll probably delete it later if it doesn't get deleted by someone else because I didn't even think to read the rules properly. I feel a little bit better actually making my thoughts and feelings have a physical manifestation but I feel like it's only a temporary and fruitless endeavour to find relief but at least for now I can somewhat breathe so thankyou for having a place to post about these events."
physical,Should I keep calling the police on my neighbor?,"I keep hearing screams and other concerning things through the walls from my neighbor's apartment. There will be banging, and a woman (or maybe child?) screaming. I've heard a man shouting. The only two phrases I heard him say clearly were:  ""On your knees, get on your fucking knees,"" and ""You want some more of this? Huh?""  Is this domestic violence? What if I'm wrong?  The first few times it happened, I brushed it off as TV sounds or a kid throwing a tantrum. But recently I saw my neighbor trying to shut the door on her boyfriend while begging him to leave. He pushed his way back inside, shut the door, then I heard screaming again. I called the police, but when they arrived my neighbor told them everything was fine.   I've called the police a few times since this because I heard screaming again. Every time, my neighbor tells them everything is fine and gets super pissed about the cops ""wasting"" her time. She's a black single mother who's clearly struggling, and is none too fond of cops poking into her business. Last time, she almost got in a fight with one of the officers.  My question is this: Should I keep calling the police when I hear stuff through the walls? Is this a no-win situation?  If she is being abused, I feel like I could be making it worse. If she's not being abused, I'm needlessly harassing this poor woman who's just trying to raise her kids in peace. I'm also low-key scared she or her boyfriend might kick my ass, because she knows I'm the one calling the cops.   I feel awful either way, and I keep wondering if I'm just that racist Karen who calls the cops every time her neighbors raise their voices. I smoke a lot of weed and watch a lot of true crime, so I don't 100% trust my judgement, but I'm pretty sure what I heard/saw. And she has little kids, so the stakes are that much higher.   Wtf do I do??? Any advice is much appreciated."
emotional,I hate feeling guilty,"I kicked my verbally abusive boyfriend (3.5 living together) out about 3 months ago. He was using booth space in one of my commercial buildings to cut hair (he is a licensed cosmetologist) and he was training clients in my private gym. When we broke up of course he lost those privileges. He is now cutting hair in another salon (where he pays rent) but he is not training anywhere. He is looking for a regular job (there are a lot of decent jobs here) but no luck yet, partially because he is a felon (it was 9 years ago, not sexual or violent). We are talking again because he has been undergoing the psychiatric treatment he has needed for a long time and he seems a lot better but sometimes he says things that make me feel guilty for him being in the situation he is in. I warned him many many times if he didnt stop calling me names and yelling at me and saying mean things I was going to kick him out, and I was true to my words. How can i stop feeling guilty? I am in therapy too btw and have been since before we broke up."
emotional,Going insane,"I know it takes two to tango. This situation has been going on for too long; I feel like my memory is failing me, I feel like a bad person, I feel empty.   I messed up. A few months ago, I said yes to a job abroad. It's the dream job, the job that will make my career, the kind of job you can't say no to. Since then, my partner has been understandably upset. Every other day he reminds me how unhappy he is, that I don't care about him, that I fucked him over, that I should make more efforts if I want to stay with him. The list goes on.   My apologies and my actions aren't enough. He claims I am breaking promises I made months ago, but I don't remember making any. He says I'm not texting him enough, that I'm going out too much, that I am using him as a punching bag, for then changing attitude and being super sweet with me again for a few days. He says he is always the one to reach in the middle. I know he feels the relationship is one-sided, I can't bring myself to do more because I am petrified and scared of more criticism. Maybe I should just accept it, because I did abandon him? Although, these kind of arguments where happening before I got the offer (together for 2 years). Maybe I should quit my job, if that makes him happy?   I genuinely am at a point where I don't know if I should post here or in AITA. I've been reading a lot of articles and testimonials: generally the victim is the one picking up the pieces, but in my case I am the one living the best life with my dream job. Does that make me the abuser?"
emotional,I want old myself back.I want you to feel every ounce of pain you put me through.,"I know letting go of hate is step to recovery,  but i am hurt, i lost my identity for a narcissist.  them going through the pain i went through is the only way i can cope with myself."
physical,Do you resent your neighbours for pretending not to know?,"I know my neighbours heard. They were the sort who prided themselves on being nice, helpful neighbours, but domestic violence was too much for them. They avoided eye contact with me so I thought they despised me. They were probably concerned with their own safety which is fair enough, but just once one of them could have made an anonymous call to police, you'd think? I don't know, I've left that area now, but I'll never quite understand the neighbours ignoring so much."
physical,I left but he won't stop texting me and my heart can't take it,"I know there easy answer is to block him but my heart is still open to him and the fact that I hurt him by leaving. He's been texting me literally all night, starting off sad and now ending up insanely angry. He's said I have a learning disability (because I don't realize he doesn't want to fix things anymore, that I'm psychotic, heartless (for abandoning him). I've been suicidal for weeks and this is making me feel literally lower than dirt. I feel like I don't deserve the kindness of sleeping on a friend's air mattress. I want to end this pain. I don't want to be alone. I want to go back to happy times with him. But the way he's talking to me is so bad, it makes it apparent that he isn't willing to do the work necessary to improve.  Any advice on how to get over this? We were together 7 years and I have a lot of stuff at our house. Living arrangement is temporary."
physical,Signs of abuse?,"I know this is abuse but my boyfriend of 11 years makes it seem like it isn't. Basically I did cheat on him 3 years ago and Im not saying what I did is ok by any means but ever since then he naturally does not have the trust in me which I totally understand you would think he would even in the slightest but it has been a rough road and I made poor decisions after I cheated. I have changed and I am and will not be the same person I was three years ago.   Anyways , ever since then he has repeatedly called me dumb, a bitch, a whore you name it I've been it even in front of our kids . He even has had our 7 year old call me a whore and I put her in her place while he laughs about it. Recently , he has been saying if I find out your cheating on me it will be your head rolling down the street . He said it this morning once again and I have been thinking about what he said all damn day and I don't know how he could say this to anyone whether they did anything to you or not it isn't right. I am the mother of two of his children and I am at a loss of words and I don't know what he is capable of. If anyone has been I this situation or something similar I'll take any advice . I am scared for my kids well being as well as myself even though I'm not cheating on him . He keeps thinking I have another boyfriend and that couldn't be further from the truth.  Thank you in advance."

physical,Advice for starting dating after an abusive relationship?,"I left a 5 year long abusive relationship at the beginning of this year and am now looking at going on a few dates. For some context when I started dating my abuser I was 22 and he was 26, I'd only ever been on a couple of dates before, had severe social anxiety and was super insecure. I ignored red flags because I was so desperate to feel loved and desired. I've grown a lot since then and feel confident in asserting my boundaries. I'm also bisexual/queer and was living openly so before met him. He made me hide that part of myself because ""do you have to always be so into gay shit?"". I feel like I'm having to come out all over again now. I'm also mostly interested in dating other queers at the moment but am nervous because it's been so long since I've been a part of that community.  Do people recommend being open about what I've been through? How much do you share? I know the red flags to avoid but what are some green flags?"

physical,Sending love and support to you all _¤ï_,"I left an abusive marriage 4 years ago. I'm now happily remarried to a wonderful man and we are expecting a baby in a couple of months. At each prenatal appointment, I'm given a questionnaire that includes questions about my mood, sleep and appetite. The last question asks ""Have you ever been physically assaulted or threatened by a romantic partner?"".   I've filled out this same survey multiple times and I still find myself hesitating to answer this one particular question. I know the honest answer but I still fight the urge to circle ""no"" instead of ""yes"". In those few seconds, I begin to think, if I answer ""yes"" will they ask me about it? Will they want me to tell them what happened? Will they think less of me or think I'm dramatic? Even though I know they won't do any of these things, I still feel the urge to cover up that I have been a victim of abuse. I still want to act like nothing is wrong and bury that part of my life away.   It's been years since my ex assaulted me for the last time. I've spent years recovering, healing and growing but I'm still surprised how many little ways the abuse has effected me and all the places it shows up.   I just wanted to share this with you all in case you find yourselves experiencing the same things and fighting the urge to cover up your abuse. It's such a bizarre occurrence but it's important to be honest, even when it's uncomfortable and please remember that you are more than your experiences _¤ï_"
physical,"How do I stop thinking about the abuse (apologies for the long post, any advice is appreciated greatly)","I left an emotionally abusive relationship a year ago. I was 14 (he was 16) when we met and we were together for 6 years, 6 years of hell, emotional torture, I used to think the only way out was if I moved country or killed myself. Every day I have flashbacks to things that he said or that happened in the relationship. I only realised this year that him pressuring me into sex was really rape. He gaslighted me so much, he never cared about me he always treated me like l almost didn't exist until I would want to go to see my friends or family, then he would beg to spend time with me. He used to tell me to shut up and snigger at me when I would cry, if I tried to speak about how I felt in the relationship he would simply walk out and not come home until the next day / early hours. He kicked me once when we were laying in bed because I was crying. I begged him to leave me because he clearly wasn't happy or even liked me at all but he wouldn't. Every time l left him he never left me alone, once he was due me money after we broke up and me being 16 years old needed the money back, he met me to give me it back but said I would only get it back if I had sex with him. so I did. He always accused me of cheating on him throughout our whole relationship, yet he was on the one who was always out without me knowing where he was going and getting messages through from girls. He used to hide his phone at night and turn it off so that I would never see who popped up. I tried to leave him many times throughout the years, once he threatened to drive off a bridge, once he forced his way into my home when I was home alone, once he followed me all the way to the train station and grabbed my arm so that I couldn't get on the train, once he physically restrained me in his bedroom so that I couldn't leave, once he tailgated me all the way home after I left him and he sat on my street for hours after, he found and threatened my flatmate. He would always laugh at me when I told him it was over because I would always end up back with him, he really made me feel like I could not live without him, and I did go back to him each time, I would sit and think it through and realise that I didnt have the physical or mental energy to go through a full break up with him. Its been a year now. I seen him a few times after we were broken up as I thought maybe he had actually changed, my mum told me that if I got back with him she would cut contact with me and I would be unable to see my younger brother, my mum has complex health issues and she will not live a long life, I am my brothers next of kin and have always promised her that I will look after him, so the thought of going back to my ex and not being able to support my mum or brother seriously fucked me up but it's probably the only thing my mum could've done to stop me going back.  Here I am, now, only just starting to deal with the reality of what happened to me, there is so much more than what I have spoken about today. I hope I heal but it feels like I never will, I dont think my mind will ever be the same. I reached out to him last night to tell him that I hate him, that its unfair hes healthy able to work and make money whilst I'm basically housebound due to ME and Fibromyalgia which I was only diagnosed with in the last 2 years. He doesnt care, even if I told him I wanted to die he still wouldn't care. I hate him, but the only thing that can make me feel better is him. It is so fucked up. I really need validation on this. Am l crazy for needing his comfort, I dont want to be with him at all now but I want him to speak to me and hold me then leave me alone. I know that it wouldn't work like that though."
physical,Disturbing realization,"I left my abuser and am in the healing process. Last November we were in the car at a drive in theater and I wanted to fool around. It was hot and cramped and he was having trouble performing, which I told him was not a big deal and we should just stop. But that just got him angrier. He started punching me in the back of the head saying it was my fault because I was so fat. I was lying down in the backseat on my belly. He then put his hands around my neck and started choking me. I kept reaching for the door handle but my fingers couldn__ quite get to the door handle. I kept thinking that I was going to die and no one could help me even though there were tons of cars around. I finally was able to open the door but he still was strangling me. I ended up defecating and that caused him to stop. I jumped out of the car and he was yelling at me how disgusting I was because I had pooped on his jacket. I could barely keep my eyes open and kept feeling like I was going to pass out. I would love to say I left him right after that but no it took more than 5 months to finally leave him. I told a friend today and she told me that the fact that I defecated was incredibly scary and probably meant that I was close to death. That realization scared me so bad. I mean I know it was serious but I don__ know, it hit me hard hearing that. Anyone else have something similar?"
emotional,How long does it take?,"I left my husband early this year. I was in it for six years. He would escalate everything I brought up. I__ not a fighter but one time he berated me so badly for buying the wrong beer that I was finally yelling back (he texted me to buy something and apparently the text was sarcastic. He yelled at me for not knowing better and not knowing what he liked so I asked him what my favorite wine was and he just stopped dumbfounded. Yeah) I surprised myself by doing that but talked myself into that being a good thing that we were able to fight. But it wasn__ a productive argument, it was him taking out his feelings on me. Our divorce was as bad as I knew it would be. He said a lot of things and I never really got to say what I needed to him because he always escalated anything I did or said x1000 so I really couldn__. I wrote a letter to him and burned it. Didn__ help. I try not to think about it and I__e moved on to some degree but I still get intrusive thoughts. He doesn__ contact me at all so that__ fantastic news but Im still dealing with lawyers and him taking $25,000 of my retirement money when he literally never paid any bills ever. Yes I__ bitter, I__ trying to let it go but it__ hard. The divorce has only been final for a few months, I__ just eager to get over it because I have a new partner. But... how long will I have to deal with this anger and frustration? I know I need therapy, so I__ looking into that now. But with or without therapy... how long did it take you? I need some hope my mind won__ be cluttered with this someday."
physical,Question about changing locks,"I live in Japan, if anyone has information related to Japan I would really appreciate it. But any ideas would be wonderful.   My abuser left my apartment three months ago. Since then I have decided to separate permanently. However they never moved their stuff out and they still have a key.   I want to change the locks, not to keep their stuff, but just to get a good night__ sleep. I__ scared all the time not knowing if or when they might come back.   One self-help book (US author) said  DO tell the landlord or neighbors or whoever that you are being abused and need help. But I__e read online (in Japanese) about Landlords here refusing to rent to victims of domestic abuse.   So what do I say?"
physical,Looking for logistical and creative planning advice from those who__e gotten out of who have helped others,"I live with my highly controlling and paranoid abuser. I won__ detail all the abuse here as it__ similar to many what many of you have gone through or are going through - frequent physical violence, gaslighting, threatening blackmail, isolation- I__ once again trying to get out. I__e tried a few times before but my partner has managed to find out and thwart these efforts by monitoring my computer and emails, cutting off all social connections by spreading rumors and preventing me from talking to friends who have offered to help, and by making endless threats to my career (this is the only thing I have left at this point)_etc. I think you can imagine the repercussions of those failed attempts to get out.   Amazingly, Reddit is the one point of connection he is not onto yet so I__ trying my luck here and seeking advice. Don__ underestimate the power of the internet or this sub- it__ been a huge help for me so far as a reader.  I__ looking for creative, logistical advice from any of you who have gotten out or who have helped others. I__ doing both short and long term planning and know this time really needs to be well thought out. Most of my planning is in hard notebooks or in the notes section of my phone hidden amongst lists. Please see below considerations- if you have ANY tips at all please please let me know.   1. Computer access- he has access to my computer and he forced me to give up all my passwords to my accounts (bank, email). The last time I changed all of them, it set off alarms bells and he knew something was up. I plan to start slowly changing these one by one, and will be creating another email today too. I have a few email accounts for back up now. Any additional advice on technology safety I may not have thought of would be greatly appreciated.   2. He has installed cameras all around our house- there__ one in my bedroom, one in my office, all around the perimeter of the house etc. He claims this is for our pets but uses it to monitor my activity including if he sees me on my phone, or moving things, and to make sure I don__ leave the house if he__ not here. I__e found a few corners of the house where I can get away to but this has made things very difficult.  Sometimes when I__e had it I will __ccidentally_ unplug them, but a firestorm usually follows. Anyone else ever had this experience?  3. He is unemployed and has no car- I work from home. My reasons to leave the house often need to be iron clad, I can__ just go for a drive or go shopping. Often going to get a coffee or to get groceries has been my time to try and get in planning and doing things like this post.  He rarely leaves the home. He__ also installed gps tracking on my phone so anytime I leave he knows where I am. I__e tried playing dumb and like I don__ understand technology and deleting it a few times, but it always ends up back on my phone. Do any of you have believable excuses that you have used to buy time to get out of your home even for a few hours?  4. The other issue I__ trying to work through is we have pets. In particular my cat who spends every minute of the day with me and has been the one thing helping me through this. He__ threatened many many times to prevent me from taking her and to sue me  if I ever try to leave (even though I am the one caring and paying for her) and this has been a huge concern. Anyone who has left with a pet - please let me know any prep you did.   5. Accommodation and packing: our house has had some construction recently so I__e been able to pack things under the guise of organization for the work of the home. The question now is how to get things OUT of the house. My key docs are already stowed- I__e been down this road before. I__ trying to find short term accommodation so when I get the chance I can leave with my cat. I__ in the Massachusetts area if anyone has suggestions on where to look and how to start preparing for this.   6. Friends and family- enlisting the help of friends and family isn__ an option right now- my boyfriend will frequently take my phone from me if he is suspicious and Will ready any and all texts. Hes privy to deleting messages, trying to use code, and me changing contact names. He__ prevented my from having any social media which I used to try to use to connect with friends too. Im buying second phone to stash this weekend.  The other things like the ruining my reputation, destroying my friendships, and threatening to blackmail me endlessly I will deal with the fall out later. I__e gone this long without relationships and living in fear of retaliation I just want to get out and not dwell on the future challenges until I__ finally out. I__ trying to be thoughtful and patient through this planning so things appear calm to my abuser and so this time things will work. Thank you reddit friends for any and all tips, you guys have helped a lot of people!"
emotional,Should I breakup with my bf b/c of emotional abuse,I ll try to make it as short as possible  My boude and I are in a long distance relationship.. Today I organized a party with a few of my friends for a festival of my faith and I cooked for 1 day straight and made like 6 course dishes. My friends were clearly excited and stuff  I called my bf very excited and told him everything I did and asked if I could send him pictures and he just said lemme know if it's something important and hung up.. No reaction No response  I feel like throwing everything I made in trash and just crying myself to sleep
emotional,Is anyone else triggered by Mother Gothel in Tangled?,"I love Tangled, but I literally can__ watch it anymore because Gothel is too much like my own mother"
emotional,The last straw,"I made a post on here about a month or two ago, I wasn't sure if I was in an emotionally abusive relationship or not. Lots of people are telling me I am but my mind is so twisted up inside and I don't even know anymore. I can't tell if he is just really mean or what's going on. He told his parents I called him out on his behavior and they are mad and against me now for saying he is abusive but they don't think he is because ""he doesn't mean the things he says"". And they were upset that I was afraid he was going to get physical when I confronted him for cheating because ""he would never do such a thing"". He was upset I thought he would get physical because he would ""never hit a woman"" but he told me in another argument that if I was a man he would've hit me by now and that I make him want to hit me but ""he never would"" of course.   He will get extremely mean or angry, take it out on me then get all affectionate the next day or something similar. We started to go to therapy but I'm now realizing that he is a different person in our sessions and I'm just so fed up and snippy during them I'm the problem and she just talks about that. I feel my emotions are invalidated by both of them, when I cry he gets upset and either laughs or goes on about how I'm being dramatic. One other time he told me to ""holster my tears"" that what I was upset about wasn't a big deal, and it really wasn't. I was upset because I felt he was giving me the silent treatment and we got into an argument about that and I started crying (I do that when I get frustrated, and well I'm a crier it's what I do). I brought up how I felt like we had an imbalance of Household work and that I felt like I was raising a teenager and not in a partnership with a grown man (he 29M and I'm 24F). Basically the therapist said he didn't have to cook or clean or eat what I made and that I could stop cleaning, and how it shouldn't be an expectation for him to do anything when I thought thats what partners do (we both have full time jobs with about the same hours). Anyway not super important but I feel invalidated and now he uses that argument as a weapon against me constantly saying I called him a child and goes on and on. He lied telling the therapist I don't do anything around the house like the dishes or clean the bathroom and things like that and she believed him. Still not super important but I found that super upsetting, I feel like he is trying to vilianize me.  When we first started therapy I told him the only thing I wanted from him was loyalty and him to not treat me like shit. And all he had to say is ""it's not that easy!"" We kept expressing that the reason we had a fight free weekend was because he was bottling everything up and it took so much energy for him to not be outright mean to me. Things that I consider outright mean was him offering to go to the store for me but when I politely declined he said ""I wasn't going to do it anyway"" or when we were at a restraunt I made a corny joke to the waiter and they laughed he said ""you're really not that funny, they only laughed because that's their job"" after they left.  Anyway, that is my rant but earlier today something happened that was the last straw for me (as if I wasn't given enough reason to leave before). We got into an argument, that I mightve started but he was letting his puppy eat off his plate...like right off the plate and wasn't correcting him. It's a cane corso and is 40lbs at 15 weeks, the dog needs discipline now or it's going to be even more of an issue as it gets older. He goes on to say ""you want me to make him cry because if I make him cry I'm going to make 'someone else' cry"" and looked at my dog angrily. My dog is my one greatest love in life. I love her more than I love myself and at this point more than I love the man I'm bound too by law. I'm not saying she is perfect but she doesn't do anything outright bad or naughty, this bothers my husband since he can't get mad at her for much so he complains constantly about how she wants attention ""too much"" and how she whines to come inside, it's winter and she has arthritis she can't be left outside in the cold like the other two dogs. So he threatened my dog and we eventually went into our room, my dog was beside me at the bed and my husband was playing video games. Our roommates dog, a little pitbull, wandered into our room and my husband yelled at him to leave and the dog did but wandered back into the room. I watched my husband stand up and kick the dog as hard as he could out of anger and to get him out of the room. In that instant I felt any feeling I had left for that man die...  Watching him hurt the other dog and threaten my dog was the final straw for me. I know that the situation for my dog is increasingly dangerous, next month I will be at a school for the army and will have long hours. I do not trust that he will not hurt her while I'm gone or to even care for her properly while I'm away so I will have to send her away to live with my parents two states away. I'm pretending like everything is fine at the moment as I slowly get everything in line for me to leave, first step is to get the dog out and then I'm deploying soon so that will be my escape from him. I don't think he will hurt me but I'm sure he would sure my dog and I couldn't live with myself if something ever happened to her because I was too blind to prevent it. Sorry for that long post but I felt like i had wrote it down somewhere so I wouldn't back out of my plan....any words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Or stories of how you got out would be nice too, I'm just sitting here alone on Xmas eve with nothing going on."
emotional,Am I Truly Unlovable?,"I made a post on my primary but regretted it.  My mother once told me that I was impossible to love because I was fat and __at people are lazy and lazy people are unsuccessful and no one loves fat, lazy, unsuccessful people_  My entire life I__e just wanted for one moment where I felt like it was possible for someone to love me but it hasn__ happened.  Not even close  All I want is to be loved.  All I want is a home free from screaming and broken dishes and talk of rapist family members.  I just want a small home with someone I love and maybe a dog or two.  I just want to be happy with someone, but why does it seem so impossible?  It feels like my entire bloodline is cursed.  None of us are allowed to be happy.  We__e all victims or victimizers and I just want to be happy.  But I don__ think it__ possible.  No one else in my family has ever been happy and why should I think I__ better than them?  Am I truly just impossible to love?  Am I really cursed?  Can I ever hope for anything better?"
emotional,Leaving an emotionally abusive relationship at 18,"I met him when I was 17, 10 months later on Christmas Eve I finally had the courage to call him up and leave (yes i know calling is a very crappy thing to do). It__ now day 2 and I have lots and lots of mixed emotions on if I should stay or leave. He was very cruel and mean to me. He called me the abusive one and I missed many school exams because of him. I wish I could go back to the good memories and re live them and I wish more than anything that he would change. Christmas Eve was my last straw. If you play Pok_©mon go you know that you can join raids with your friends. Since he wasn__ at my family__ Christmas party I decided to invite him to the raid. The timer ran out and the raid started with me and 3 other family members without him. Even with the smallest things he would make it seem like I didn__ do enough to make him feel included and we argued about it. I decided that it was the last time he would argue with me over small things and ruin something that was important to me. I told my family about all the abuse I went through and that night I ended it. I__ tired of trying to change him and I__ tired of waking up with shame."
emotional,I feel like I want him back to abuse me again :(,I miss the abuse then the love bombing. It felt so intimate. I feel like I'm only attracted to bad men now due to my trauma. A 'normal' guy who can offer me a healthy relationship (which I want so bad) doesn't feel anything like the abusive ex. Help?
physical,Help dealing with sister in denial or just used to it,"I moved my sister and her 3 year old son from out of state into my house because the situation with her bf was getting out of control. He__ got extreme jealousy issues, anger issues, you know, the works. Plus he__ mentally ill and exposes himself in public and masturbates in front of people.  After moving my sister up here, the bf followed. My sister kept this a secret from me until I found out from my mother who lives with me.  Long story short, the bf makes me and my mother feel unsafe. He__ not allowed here or in front of our house because of his behavior. The cops know this and have his license plate number. Sister thinks we are over reacting. If my sister keeps defending him and putting her son in an abusive situation am I right in telling her to move out? Or what should I do?"
emotional,I need to settle this once and for all,"I need help deciding if my mother is abusive or if I__ insane, because at this point I do not trust my own judgement.  Some context on my mother__ background:  She grew up literally dirt poor. As in she lived in a house with dirt floors and one of the walls was just plastic. She got pregnant at 18 with my brother, and the way she described that marriage was very much a battered wife type of scenario. Her parents also were not great, and she has several other family members with emotional and mental problems. Her half sister is literally in a mental institution for the rest of her life and considered a danger to herself and others. She has undoubtedly been abused in her life, financially, emotionally, and probably physically though she__ never mentioned it. The only thing I don__ think she__ been through is sexual abuse but it__ not impossible that she just hasn__ told me. She went through 3 divorces, an extremely messy custody battle with my dad and paternal grandmother, she insists me and my brother were stolen from her through  a coordinated and deceitful smear campaign and lies against her.  It__ clear to me as an adult that she has never gotten over a lot of the traumas in her lifetime. She has always been independent to a fault, to the point of detriment. She is successful now, owns her own business, is single with no dependants or financial obligations beyond her house and business. She is very well off, especially compared to where she used to be, and clearly enjoys the comfort she fought so hard for. She is very vain, buys the best and most expensive of everything (clothes, jewelry, personal care products, household goods, etc) and regularly comments on goods she sees as being inferior as being __hetto_ or __oochie_. I know this is just a result of her lifelong financial insecurity, but I still find it upsetting because she refers to the stores in her area, which has a large latinx population and the stores stock themselves accordingly to what sells among that demographic, in very derogatory ways, but when she visits me she gushes about how nice the stores here are and how everyone here has so much better taste. I live in a VERY white, very wealthy area. All the stores look like they were stocked by Joanna Gaines herself.  Here__ where we get into the things that make me question whether or not I__e been abused:  1.) My mom treats her opinions like they are facts, and if I dare to question her she immediately becomes defensive and impossible to talk to. She literally cannot fathom your point of view, no matter how well you explain it, and will literally just keep saying __ don__ understand_ or __hat makes no sense to me_. I have never once in my life seen her change her mind on anything. Ever. 2.) She is very obvious about her disdain if you voice an opinion she doesn__ agree with or if you disagree with her in any way. She may not outright tell you what she thinks, but it__ very obvious in her body language, her facial expression, and the tone of her voice. Every inch of her body will just ooze __ure, Jan_ energy, and if you point it out she insists that it__ not true. 3.) She is aggressive about assertive her opinions over me, even when I haven__ asked for them and they clearly cause me distress. Once at thanksgiving she took it on herself to inform me that she thought she knew the perfect career path for me, and explained to me all the reasons she thought I should be a tattoo artist. Now to be fair, her reasoning was sound and she took into account my personality and goals in life. But I had never asked for her opinion on the subject, and furthermore I was going through a serious existential crisis at that time and the thought of having my art on someone else__ body was enough to send me into a panic. I explained this to her, but she wouldn__ leave me alone about it and kept insisting that I should just think about it and she would help pay for tattoo school (without even knowing if that was a thing or not). She kept pushing even when I asked her to stop, and even when I started crying. She was more interested in being right and __ixing_ my problem than in respecting my feelings.  Another time, I came to visit her and noticed she had Trump 2020 mugs proudly displayed on her mantle. I was deeply disappointed but didn__ say a word, because I knew it was pointless and didn__ want to start a fight. However, later that day she remembered they were there and loudly proclaimed that she was soooooo sorry, and ____l just put these away because I know how upset they will make you_. She could have just silently put them away, but instead she had to make sure she drew my attention to them. I don__ even know if she does these things with intent or not, or if she just doesn__ think about the consequences of her actions. 4.) She is extremely reactive. I feel like I constantly have to watch what I say around her because she gets upset at the slightest things. If I ever talk about my childhood with my father, she shuts down and won__ speak to me for the entire day. It__ like speaking to a PTSD victim, so I just... don__ talk about those things. And if I slip, I try to immediately change the topic to do damage control. It never works. Because of this I barely talk to her about anything of any substance. I keep most of my conversations with her at surface level. 5.) She claims that I am the sensitive one. Any time she says or does something that makes me feel bad, or that I find unacceptable in front of my kids, I try to correct her as gently as possible. She cannot handle the slightest pushback and immediately becomes defensive. She treats me like I__ a fire breathing dragon just looking for any chance to bite her head off, which is ridiculous considering how much time and effort I spend thinking about every goddamn word I say to her, trying to take her insecurities and unresolved trauma into account and avoid hurting her at all costs. It__ exhausting!  We are currently NC after a fight regarding her using the n-word in front of my kids. I told her that there was no context in which that word was okay, and tried to set a firm boundary that if she ever used it again we would not be speaking. This was the first time I__e ever drawn a line in the sand with her, and I made it clear this was a hill I was willing to die on. She completely lost her damn mind. That was when I realized that I couldn__ deal with her any more. I told her I was blocking her on everything, and that I would speak to her again when she got therapy.  Multiple people have told me she__ a narcissist, but she doesn__ fit the full profile for a narcissist. And there are a lot of good things about her that I couldn__ include here because it would just be so so much. She__ so strong, I__e never felt that she didn__ love me or my children, and I know that this NC is probably killing her. In her mind, I was stolen from her as a kid, and now she probably feels like her grandkids have been stolen from her too. I truly believe, in my heart, that her behavior is a result of unresolved trauma and that we can have a future relationship if she takes the necessary steps to deal with it. But am I too harsh? Have I been too sensitive? I constantly feel like I__ just taking her behavior and blowing it out of proportion, making mountains out of molehills, but I don__ know what else to do or any other way to interpret it all. Every time we interact, I feel like shit for days afterwards. I can__ live like that."
physical,How to make the escape plan?,"I need help on making the plan of leaving, i don't know who can help me to plan it cause i know there's like social workers or something bthat help you plan it, crate a safe and logical plan to leave, there's even a woman on tiktok i saw that do that with women but i don't know what or where should I look for"
emotional,Am I Abusive,"I need help to identify  whether or not I'm the problem My husband (34M) have accused me (28F) of being emotionally and verbally abusive.  These accusations was made after I decided to confront him about his aggressive behavior.  1 of many examples of this behavior is that he woke up this morning with a headache,  so he walked into the living room (after sleeping in) grabbed our 6 yo by his hair and yelled at him for watching cartoons while there is toys out in his room. Then turned and screamed at our 2 yo about toys in the living room.  I stated that I know he isn't feeling well but to please not yell at the children. He then turn around and yelled at me for not cleaning, I have been sick enough to be booked of by the doctor for the past week, and unfortunately both my kids got sick too, so my attention have been on them instead of vacuuming.  He screamed that I was lazy and using the kids and being sick as an excuse, and that I never contribute. (Side note, I work full time and take care of the kids full time since he works evenings (5pm to 10 pm) and likes to sleep during the day due to this). To make a long story short, when he finally cooled down, I asked him what triggered this and his answer is the same as every time he blows up, he said ""You make me like this! All you do is sit and do nothing while insulting me and you turned me into this!""  So am I abusive? How do I fix this? Because everytime I point out his anger and aggressive behavior towards me and the kids I get told it's my fault and I make him like this with my abuse..."
emotional,"Sexual Coercion, Unwanted Physical Touch (Groping), Gaslighting, and Victimization","I need help with all of these.  I read articles and such and I know all about what they are, but I don__ really know how to avoid/prevent/deflect.  I am filing for divorce in March 2022.  I have about 6 more months with my spouse and I need to get some sanity.  If I deny him sex or any physical intimacy he gets so mean.  He pouts, refuses to help around the house, won__ do anything for our children, belittles me, accuses me of having an affair, acts entitled to my body, etc.  I find having sex with him to be repulsive.    Sex or no sex he constantly gaslights me, if he can__ spin the blame back on me, the conversation ends and the stonewalling begins.  Finally he is always the victim.  Any chance he can make himself the victim and not be accountable or responsible, he takes it.  This shit has been going on almost the entire marriage (almost 9 years).  I have been so unhappy for the last 8.  I didn__ necessarily feel worthless or inadequate, but I also didn__ realize that he was emotionally abusive up until a few months ago.  He is passive aggressive and doesn__ call me names or anything, but he implies things like that I__ a whore without calling me one.  He doesn__ lose his temper and throw tantrums or break things.  So he has subtly been getting away with it this whole time.  How do deflect gaslighting?  Walk away? Call him out?  Same with stonewalling  Finally the sex issue.  I hate sex with him.  It feels like I am being raped even though I gave consent.  Do I just suffer until the divorce?  Not have sex and deal with the additional bs?    Thanks in advance for suggestions and help."
physical,relocate away from abusive mother during uk lockdown,"I need to get to either my flat or my boyfriend's house despite the national lockdown.  I've been living at home for the Christmas holidays to keep the peace with my family as I'm still pretty financially reliant on them (I'm a  uni student). It has been an awful experience. My mother is very controlling and manipulative. She seems to take every chance she has to tear me down. She only hasn't gotten physical because I haven't spoken back to her or tried to stand up for myself - I learnt that one the hard way. I won't get into any more details or past experiences but just know that staying here for a month has set me back so far with my mental health. I've never reported her and there's no evidence of abuse since it  hasn't been physical recently so I don't know if that would be a viable excuse if I was pulled over by police on the way there. Also, my father was planning on driving me halfway there so I definitely cannot use that if I'm in the car with him. All I know is that I can't stay here and have a breakdown every day until mid-February."
emotional,"I need to report my ex, but dont feel ready to? (F UK)","I need to report emotional, sexual and physical abuse from my ex. I have little/no valid evidence. I have been left with cpstd post breakup and has affected my life massively. I'm suffering and need to report but live in a cycle of fear for the repercussions. Any advice moving forward? I dont feel ready to report, but I dont want to keep putting it off/waste time. It's a massive thing for any victim to do."
physical,Advice Wanted,"I need urgent advice. I__ planning on leaving my abusive husband of 5 years and I need tips on doing so. The abuse has really crippled me emotionally and I__ planning on leaving him today when he leaves for work. Today he attacked me again after 9 months of abuse. Attacks are more frequent now happening weekly instead of monthly. I__ heading straight to the police once he leaves for work. I have documented some of the abuse. Also, I__ leaving with our 18 month old son. Thinking of going to my mom__ house, except he knows where she lives. My husband is a very dangerous person he has no limit it seems. I cannot stay in this marriage. Please advice is needed."
physical,Is this abusive of me to do?,I opened a private savings account to help me put money aside to leave my abuser. I just feel so guilty and yesterday I read that hiding money is abusive.
emotional,Is this financial abuse?,"I operate a small biz.  It was started by my husband but he could not handle the stress.  He can't handle any stress tbh.  About 6 years ago he had to be hospitalized for theatening to commit suicid citing the financial stress if the biz as one of the key factors.  In the past when faced with the slightest but of financial stress he has also had manic episodes of wanting me to help him create lists of all of our belongings to sell.  During the time of his break down (not the first) we superated, almost got divorced and I took over the biz as it was actually my idea/dream to begin with.  After about a year we got back together.  I have never shown him any biz financials out of fear that the cycle will repeat, or that he will tell me I should stop doing it.  Something he told me often when I initially took over and was struggling.  He claims me not showing him any of the info is financial abuse.  I've read a bit about it and it's kind of unclear to me if it is or not.  To be clear, he has never once respected my boundaries when I tell him what I need to feel safe in having a conversation about my business.  It has ALWAYS been brought up by him in anger, and usually when we are having a disagreement about something else.  We have a joint personal bank account, I am the primary on that account becaus it was originally just mine, he has full access to this account.  He is the secondary card holder on my credit card, and I have a savings account that we both put money into.  He knew I was opening the savings account, he did not want to make time to participate in opening the savings account so I couldn't put his name on it be used he didn't come with me to set it up.  I show him at least every month how much is in the savings account.  All of my business finances are in separate accounts, as they should be.  I'm open to hearing any opinions on this situation."
emotional,Confused on what__ what,"I originally posted and deleted it saying I was going to break up w/ my SO. It didn__ happen. I have moments of clarity of what I think is right or wrong and then I become confused and wonder if I am not giving him the chance he deserves.   At this point, everyone in my life is sick of the back and forth and I don__ blame them. It__ exhausting.   My SO and I have been together a little over a year and a half. It__ hard to write everything down about our relationship. The issues of the past year have been drug use on his end (I__e never seen or been around hard drugs so that was a whole issue) alcohol for both of us, lies, accusations, manipulation, gaslighting, name calling, screaming fights, me being kicked out and screamed at. I just thought it was me being sensitive but also knowing it was unhealthy. And the last time he screamed and kicked me out was so intense I was determined to not stay with him because I had a feeling he would love bomb me and beg for forgiveness because that has been the pattern. He did. He promised to drop his insecurities and there would be no more fighting. There has been two fights and I am to blame for one of them. But I__e been feeling like my reactions are because I__e become defensive and angry due to our history but he says I__ not allowed to hold that against him and I can__ use that to justify my actions. I guess he__ right but the reason I ignored him is because he called me 20 times and it gives me flashbacks of our last fight where he called me for hours constantly to scream at me and said extremely hateful things. It__ too long to explain if you need more info I can give it. Just feels like a lot to type right now.   I__e been anxious and upset the past week and a half because I__e done a lot of reflecting on our relationship and myself in general. I__e brought up my unhappiness with our past and how it has taken a toll on me and changed me not for the better. He says it__ not fair to hold that against him and that he has done everything I__e asked him to do_ therapy and we have an appointment for couples therapy. Which I__ scared for because he__ been using his therapy sessions against me. I__e never used mine against him even though my therapist is the one who opened my eyes to it being an abusive relationship.   Do I give him a chance? Will couples therapy help? I__e been feeling really defeated and like I__e lost a part of me. I get moments where I__ ready to leave and never look back and then I get this feeling of either not wanting to leave or unable to. I love him but i can__ just get over our past. I still hear the hate in his voice and the mean things he said_ should I just forget about it? I feel like I can__. I__ open to DMs too just need clarity from someone who is or has been in a similar position_"
physical,Why do I feel like I wasn__ abused enough? Why does a part of me keep saying I need to go back and let it keep happening?,"I posted yesterday about feeling like a fraud, and I__ wondering if it__ related.  I just feel like I left before I was supposed to, in a way.. I feel like I should still be there, letting it get worse. I feel like I got off too easy, knowing other people have had it worse.  It sounds really selfish. I should be glad I got out when I did, and that I was lucky to have somewhere to go.  Why do I feel like this? I__ afraid it makes me a bad person, a selfish person. I__ at such a loss."

emotional,"thanks mom, you've really outdone yourself.","I realise I'm writing this in pure spite but I know that everything I say is just the godawful truth so bear my vent please. My mother has successfully, over the past few months taken every bit of my identity in a way that I am left now with this corpse of a person that I slip into and wake up every morning in and play the role of. It's so fascinating to me how she did it so efficiently, all of the trust and the love and respect I once had in her is now replaced with trauma and resentment and whatever this person is that I have become so much so that my own internal monologue sounds foreign to me.  But it gets better, I get to live in this house that I never get to leave because of her need to control my every move so I can't even try and get over all the past trauma I have because I'm still caught in the midst of the present.  There is no logical way for this woman, this covert narcissist to ever see the pain and misery that she has caused me. I have forgotten what it's like to not feel like I have five daggers shoved down my throat all the time."

emotional,I__ told by my parents that I emotionally manipulate people,"I really don__ even know if this is the right place, I just keep getting told by my parents that I emotionally manipulate people. I don__ even know what I__ doing, I can__ maintain a fucking relationship to save my life, I fuck up every friendship I have tried to make for the past 3 years and I genuinely can__ stand being on this planet anymore.   I was at my friends last night for New Years and I just had one beer, then sat in the bathroom and cried for the next 4 hours and thought of ways I could hurt myself.   I feel like I__ so manipulative emotionally that I even manipulate myself at this point.   If this isn__ the right place for this can someone help me out, I need to get this under control."
emotional,Accepting/Welcoming new love,"I recently got out of a 3+ year relationship in which I did all of my __irst times_ with. (I realized the red flags very late:P). I am 19 now and going to college, yet feel very closed off to the idea of love and finding a new partner. I also was always wanting to save physical intimacy for marriage but was strongly __ncouraged_ by my ex to not, so I feel like my faith and values are broken_ leaving me even more confused where my boundaries lie. I feel like things won__ be as special the second or third time around and I__l be more anxious of __ove_/committing if I DO get in a relationship. Part of me worries I__l compare moments to those in my previous relationship, leaving me unsatisfied. When things are done again in the next relationship do they feel redundant or are they more/just as enjoyable? What can I tell myself to be more welcoming of future relationships and my feelings in those relationships? (After my abusive one). Would it be OK to bring this (including my ex) up in a future, budding relationship?  Tl;dr: got out of first committed relationship that was very amazing but gradually red flags became serious. Worried I will compare future relationship moments to those with my ex. Worried those moments will feel redundant. More insecure from my ex and I feel burnt out on putting in effort faith no long term result. What can I do to accept/pursue love?"
physical,Ended it with new guy and feel horrible after.,"I recently wrote this post here about red flags early on with a new guy:  [Red flags with new man? : domesticviolence (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/qsayoj/red_flags_with_new_man/)   &amp;#x200B;  I ended it the other day and he knew why. Like I told him why and that I can't deal with the putdowns and the pressure with the alcohol/sex stuff. He just kept calling and saying sorry then I thought well I'll give it another try, then a few days later he blocked me when he was trying to send me a bit of money for food (he literally told me to tell him when I need his help with buying food as he makes more than enough money), and I didn't answer my phone quick enough. I'd assume to punish me from ending it earlier. I'll just let him have that feeling of power because at least then he thinks he's the one ending it and will probably leave me alone anyway you know. He knew I was in a good mood with an upcoming work trial this week too. I don't know how he managed to make me feel so horrible about myself so quickly. At least it's over I guess."
physical,I hate how people assume being an adult means you can just simply move out and avoid abuse,"I said this in a previous post and I will say it here aswell as I feel like this is the sort of thing no one ever talks about.  I hate it when I go on posts and people say {not towards me, but towards others} ""You're 18 now, you can just move out"". Do they think it's so fucking easy to juat simply move out? It's not easy, you can't just simply move out. You have to work to save up, but i'm I'm not even allowed to do that, but they want my 2 sisters to.   You have to look for houses which is alot harder since I was never allowed to do anything inderpendantly and was forced to rely on my parents {they expect me to just magically know this stuff}, you have to pack up which is alot of hard work and I don't want my abusive dads help and then you have to arrange transport to move stuff and so much more. My mother got me a false autism diagnosis so that if I defend myself in any way, she can tell people I'm autistic and I am lashing out!   I see this alot when adults ask for support. ""but you're 18 now, you can move out"" ""you're an adult, you can always move out"" ""you're continuing to let them abuse you, just move out and you won't have to suffer"" ""why are you living here still? move out"".  It makes me feel like a prisoner. I hate how all the support goes towards children. I'm not saying it shouldn't, but adults are also defenceless aswell, and we can't all just simply move out. Whenever I see an adult getting told to just move out, it feels like peopme are dismissing and blaming adults to. I feel like there needs to be more resources to help adults aswell. I'm sick of the narrative that only kids are defenceless, abused adults are defenceless to!   It's not that theh feel like they can't, sometimes they physically can't. I will be an adult in a few months time and I know for a fact that I cannot physically move out. I'm not allowed a job {my parents won't help me and if I do then I will get berated for trying to move out before I get married for religious reasons}.    Just like kids, adults are held captive aswell, but why can't people also help defenceless adults aswell? Yes it's easier to move out as an adult, but the amount of prejudice towards adults in abusive households angers me {even when I was a defenceless kid, it would anger me}."
physical,I realized I was sexually abused by my ex 4 months after breaking up.,"I saw a tiktok that talked about how bdsm play without any aftercare is just abuse. I thought __ell duh,_ but started thinking about how my ex had treated sex in general, even outside of bdsm play. When me (22f) and my ex (22m) had sex, he often coerced me, had some form of non consensual rough physical contact, or lacked any aftercare or check-in on my well-being. And sometimes, he would even try to touch me before I woke up in the mornings and would throw tantrums if I said no to sex in general. Note: we engaged in mild bdsm throughout the relationship, and he stopped asking for my consent for things after a couple of months into the relationship.  Before realizing this, I was open to talking to him again down the road and even to see if there was something to rekindle. But now I just feel paralyzed. I fully blocked his number, his social media accounts, and even unfollowed any friends of his.   The hardest part is that I am shocked that I didn__ realize it over the course of our year long relationship and that it took so long for me to realize it after. It__ like it takes all of the bad qualities of the relationship and magnifies them. And honestly, I felt like I had moved on well from the breakup when it was only looking at the fucked up non-physical aspects of the relationship. I just feel so gross now.  I__ posting this because I don__ really know where to go from here. I know I didn__ deserve it. I know none of it is my fault. I know that sometimes these things take time to realize. But I never really thought I would be in this position. Or that I didn__ realize it while it was happening when I felt used or hurt emotionally and physically."
physical,Custody and Recounting Abuse for the Court,"I separated from my abusive spouse. We have a toddler and I__ going to request full custody and an order of protection tomorrow.  Should I list *every* occurrence of domestic violence that I can remember that happened and give it to my attorney? If yes, how much detail do I need to provide for each occurrence? Can I just say - 1) Physical abuse: __ few examples_; 2) Emotional abuse: __ few examples_... etc... (This is so traumatizing to recount all of this.) Will it help ensure that I am the full custodial parent for my child__ safety?  My spouse has done the nearly the full spectrum of abuse - physical, psychological, emotional, verbal, and financial - all except sexual. I am tired. I want this to be over. I am willing to do whatever I need to do now to try to prevent things from dragging on later."
physical,Sharing my story + Advice,"i should have left the moment he told me he killed a cat when he was younger for fun. I (f20) and my ex (m19) were together for almost a year and a half. In that year and a half he called me a bitch, useless, stupid, fat, ugly, r*tarted, crybaby probably 100s of times. He tried committing suicide in february and then blamed it on me because im the one who apparently was __agging_ on him that day.  During the summer when we were having an argument he punched me in the thigh so hard it left a bruise. He isnt a small man hes 6_3, 265 and built. I was scared one day he would hurt me. The night before i left him we went for an evening drive around my city and when i tried to speak he put his fingers to his lips and said __hush no talking_. He turned down a side dark road and i legitimately feared for my life . He told me he and his friends would fantasize about picking up hookers and beating them. Not too long before i left him he told me when he was a child he would think about going and touching his other child cousins. He is legitimately sick in the head. I was too scared at that point to leave him. He emailed me yesterday to ask to hook up, the second i denied him he proceeded to tell me hes already slept with another girl. It__ disgusting. I don__ want what i went through to happen to another girl. The year and a half of mental tournament was traumatizing. the walking on egg shells, making parts of myself smaller to make him happy. My whole family knew right away there was something wrong with him, they all told me he was off and not a nice guy and not my person. Its been almost a month since i left and already my life has drastically improved and i am becoming myself again."
physical,I slept with my abusive ex last night,"I slept with my ex last night and I just need to vent. I__ really angry with myself right now. It__ been a little more than a year since I left him after we got into a fight where he was drunk and slapped me and I hit back. He beat the shit out of me and threw me into a mirror. I decided I was done helping him and a line was drawn in the sand and it was crossed. It was really difficult for me mentally after that. He apologized profusely afterwards and I forgave him, but it still gets to me sometime. He just showed up at a get together with some of my friends and he looked so much better. I didn__ even know he knew the same people I did. and we really were just back to the time where we couldn__ get enough of each other. I__e been acting pretty crazy lately and told me self fuck no don__ go there when I saw him. I ignored him for a while, but eventually talked to him because I do really care about him and wanted to see how he was. Little bit of alcohol later and I just completely made the decision and ignored everything I told myself not to do. I haven__ really given a fuck about myself lately, so I guess that__ what I get for not taking care of myself and being self-destructive.   Anyway, can somebody relate? I know it__ a pretty shitty thing to do so you don__ have to tell me. I__e recently started to see a therapist so I obviously have a lot of things to figure out and work through."
emotional,Do you ever feel like nobody understands what you're going through?,"I spent my life being subjected to emotional abuse, manipulation, and verbal abuse from a mother that almost certainly qualifies as a textbook covert narcissist.  Despite being a pretty toxic individual who has caused me tremendous harm, she manages to project a very respectable outward appearance to the world of somebody who is compassionate and devoted to her children.   I've also got essentially no support from my family (and my family is tiny; one side is estranged and there just aren't many relatives on my mother's side).   My sister is what I believe they call a flying monkey. My uncle (mom's brother) is sympathetic but essentially disinterested in getting involved in the ""drama."" Both have repeatedly gaslit me by affirming that it's my responsibility as a son to maintain a relationship with my mother no matter what. I believe that I have the option and entitlement to end the relationship in the interest of preserving me own mental health. That point has long since arrived.   The above is well and good but it also feels at times like I'm living out some kind of imagined reality. The only person who understands what I've been through ... is me. My family don't realize most of the toxicity because I haven't really shared it (and now they don't want to hear from me). Until recently, I'd never so much as hinted at this to a friend. And of course what goes on behind closed doors is hermetically hidden from the world.  There's gaslighting from family. But sometimes I even feel as if I'm being gaslit by the world. Because people can't just ""get away"" with being emotionally abusive ... right? (Wrong - they absolutely can!)  Thanks for listening. If you connect with the feeling feel free to share a comment."
emotional,He__ like a human iceberg,"I split up with my narc bf 3 times &amp; we are currently back together &amp; dating as opposed to living together. He is treating me pretty coldly as he reckons my behaviour was at fault to him &amp; I need to prove myself to him.  So at the moment, it feels like he is putting in 20% effort &amp; my effort is like a million per cent. His level of communication has dropped as when we were dating before, he literally couldn__ get enough of me ( more than likely love bombing)  I__ finding his behaviour extremely off putting &amp; even though he spent a lot of money on me in Victoria__ Secret at the weekend &amp; we had a relatively good weekend together &amp; we are planning to spend a few days away together at the end of this month, because he isn__ putting in the effort, it__ making me not want to either but any hint of criticism to him &amp; he explodes in anger &amp; starts to threaten the relationship."
emotional,My moms been gaslighting me since age 11,"I started meeting people online when I was 11 years old, at first it was neopets then I got old for a MySpace an email. But the thing is I__e met Jeremy a famous guy, Brian another famous guy 2 Adams who were famous a famous singer named Katy but then again even when they are talk right in front of me or about me or they are standing right THERE she tells me they are not and acts like I__ crazy. Things have escalated before with physical abuse or violence I__ 26 living on disability and I have nowhere to go."
physical,How to I convince my friend that not all men are abusers?,"I started talking with a friend of mine and he said that he's been abused in multiple relationships. He barely trusts men anymore. He's sworn off relationships completely and it actually hurt inside thinking that he's in that place. He's a wonderful guy and I don't even know if it's even my desire to date him. I just have this internal desire to hold him and take his pain away. I want to show him that he can trust someone.   I get what it's like to be abused. I was never in an abusive relationship. I had a life from hell from the time I started middle school through high school. I was always scared of people because I'd always get threats to be beaten. I've had someone try to run me over with their truck for fun. Was verbally and mentally abused by everyone from the time I got on the bus, to the time I went home. I've been through wanting to kill myself, having no self confidence, and not trusting anyone into my late 20s. It's caused me years of depression, mood swings, psychosis, and just random anxiety and fear of people.   I don't want someone else feeling the same way. I know this pain doesn't go away immediately but I just want to help be the stepping stone for something better. If it's as a friend then so be it but I really care about this person and I never care about people."
physical,DON'T WAIT.,"I stayed in a physically and emotionally abusive relationship for over ten years. I let someone hit me, throw me, sit on my chest, scream at me at the top of their lungs, throw things at me, cheat on me, stalk me, wish my death, blame me for his suicidal thoughts and then ultimately attempt to file a restraining order against ME. I don't know why I never left, I don't know why I didn't stand up for myself or fight back. I thought I deserved it. I should have filed for help a long time ago but I never did, I never called the police, I confided in friends and my therapist but I will never forgive myself for not holding them accountable for their actions. I let someone hurt me and control me for a decade. In the end, he stole my dog and the audacity to try to file an order against me as a final act of abuse (which was later dropped) leaving me with virtually nothing. DON'T WAIT. If someone is hurting you it is only going to get WORSE. Don't be like me. Please, YOU DESERVE BETTER."
physical,Victim impact Statement,"I submitted my statement. I sentencing will be next week. My advocate told me I can read it out loud in court but said if I don__ have anything new to add it would be redundant. My therapist thinks I should at least read the last paragraph. My friend who is a lawyers says I should read the entire thing.  He__ not being charged for the actual abuse... Just the violation of the restraining order. The DA told me she couldn__ prove what he originally got arrested for happened beyond a reasonable doubt but there was no question with the violation of the DV restraining order. She came at him with everything, he ended up pleading guilty so thankfully no trial.  With his sentencing i__ being granted an even longer protection and he__l get probation for a few years.  I__ grateful. It__ been such a long road to get to here. I__ scared of seeing him in court. And I still have these feelings of not want to hurt his feelings and like I__ being disloyal...   I don__ know if I__ going to read my statement out..  I__ not sure if I should.  I just want to fast forward and get past this saga"
emotional,Is my ex still being abusive? Was my response reasonable?,"I think I know the answer, but I really need a reality check.  My ex and I have kept in touch pretty regularly since we broke up a few months ago, and he's always said he wants to do whatever I need for me to heal (for example, talk less).  Over the months I've decreased contact a fair bit, but I've always given him a kind of ""transition"" heads up period at his request.  Last night I told him I needed to decrease again, because every time we speak it's like my ""shields"" are depleted and I need to regenerate them. He seemed to understand, but later asked if we could speak one more time before the decrease. I said no, but if he wanted to WhatsApp me a bit, that would be fine.  He got upset and said he didn't understand why we couldn't speak one more time. Because he had stuff he'd wanted to talk about and he said ""you don't want me feeling this way for two weeks before we talk."" I told him I felt like he was guilt tripping me, which he took exception to.  He asked for a 30 minute call and then a 10 minute call and I kept holding my ground, and it just exploded into a guilt tripping fest. ""What about MY healing and emotions? I feel like you don't care if I'm suffering. I've put in so much work prioritizing your healing since the breakup."" He kept asking me to ""meet him halfway"" and I kept saying he could WhatsApp me, but he said it wasn't a ""real"" way of meeting halfway.  Anyway many more things were said, and it was like a 3.5 hour conversation that left me feeling small and backed into a corner... I'm not being awful to hold my ground, right? I'm trying to practice prioritizing myself and maintaining boundaries, but he made it sound like I was being so unreasonable and cold.  And it was disturbing because - why push a 10 minute call on someone who clearly doesn't want to talk? Is this just because of his drive to get his way?  Thanks for taking the time to read this saga!"
physical,Self defense,"I think this isbmore of a rant than anything but I'm open to suggestions. So yesterday my girlfriend and I broke up. We're both 29f. She got up everyday, got ready for work, and went to her cousins house instead of going to work because she had lost her job. I found out when her cousins showed up pounding on my front door demanding the money she stole from them. It was a huge fight. We've had issues with lying and jealousy but that's it. Nothing like the abuse I endured with my kids father. A while back I bought a car and put it in both of our names. She did not pay for this car. She had been drinking so I took the keys and told her to call for a ride. She chased me back and forth between both doors blocking my exit. That's the very simple version of a very intense situation that scared the crap out of me. She kept yelling for the keys to the car that she didn't buy to go drunk drive and I kept yelling for her to call a ride. At one point she was holding my arms and we were struggling. I punched her, ran, jumped a baby gate, and made it outside. She was right behind me, grabbing at me. She was trying to keep me inside. While we were outside, she continued to block me from going back inside or getting into either of my cars.  She got the keys and took the car that she didn't pay for so I'm out $1000 and can't report it stolen because we are both on the title. She is telling everyone that I abused her because I hit her in self defense and she's got a mark. I filed a police report on the incident and they wanted to arrest her. She has a warrant. I dont know what else to do. She posted pictures of her face on my social media. She telling everyone I prevented her from leaving because I didn't want her to steal my car. She's telling everyone I hit her but leaving out the fact that we were in a very scary situation and she was holding me hostage in my house. We've texted on and off all day and she's refusing to bring my car back knowing that she paid nothing for it. She's telling me I'm harassing her because I want my car. I told her I have the bank statements to prove I paid for it and she needs to return it to me and she's basically telling me I won't take her car from her. But its not her car. She's saying she can't come near me to get her stuff out of my house because I hit her but it was in self defense and she's left ever possession she owns in my house. Im afraid of what's going to happen to me. Shes twisting what happened to make herself the victim. She stole my car and drunk drove away in it after holding me hostage in my house and won't come get or send someone for any of her things or her sons things."
emotional,Looking at the past through different eyes,"I think we often post and share here when we__e in the midst of some kind of crisis or conflict. Or when we__e waking up/realising what__ been happening to us. I wanted to write something different today  I take a **ton** of photos_ or, at least I used to. In my previous career I was a photographer but also i just take a ton of day to day snaps on my phone, I almost never delete any because I have problems with executive dysfunction (which of course for worse with the abuse).   So, today I was in the middle of looking for something else in my phone__ albums and apple__ search/recommendations has been getting better and better.   To start off I__ distracted by being shown albums of our trips. I start looking and remembering how each one in the last 2 years of our relationship was their own individual hell of conflicts and me being on edge/walking on eggshells. Even older ones had moments of this.   Then I__ remembering really specific violent events that happened - when I say __iolent_ I mean psychologically, or like that one instance he drove down the freeway over the speed limit screaming at me for an hour and wouldn__ stop.   So I start digging in. A lot of my snaps are scenery, snacks/food, SO many of my cat (who often travelled with us) and selfies_ the selfies got rarer and rarer and while I used to post them to social media I started stopping. It__ part of how the isolation got so severe - he would control things like my SM or who I spoke to without ever lifting a finger, all through how he wore me down and the things he__ say to get in my head   I__ looking through_ I remember how after that trip where he terrorized me on the drive home how my cat got really sick with the worst IBD flare_ how I was told it was potentially cancer and then he forced me to go on holiday with his family before I got further tests for the poor boi.   A holiday I didn__ want to go on because his family are toxic to each other and they all pretend they__e the epitome of a perfect family. But 6-8? months prior he gaslit me into agreeing by telling me in all our 16 years we never did things for him, his family, or his friends - an absolute banger of a lie that threw me into an existential crisis because I couldn__ believe our realities could be that different_ for 16 years. This was one of the final things he needed to have complete psychological control over me for the perfect storm of me starting a new job and Covid.   My cat turned out Ok - it wasn__ leukaemia, it was IBD that had gone on undiagnosed almost his whole 5 years. A blessing in disguise maybe? But it was proof how much that nightmare of a trip and drive home had scarred and traumatized my poor baby as well.   Even after this he would continue to neglect and harm my poor best friend. My only friend in the end of things. Now I__ thinking of the time I lost it at him when he put his life in danger and I cried at him about __y_ cat and how me calling him __y_ cat sent him into an absolute violent rage where he looked at me like I was a devil he wanted to smash  You see_ all of these events look so different looking back. I__ looking through the photos of my boi, noticing the dates, thinking about the awful fights that would happen that day, how he would explode and explode. My boi looks frightened and on high alert in many. In others he is glued to me, draped across me, arms around me. My protector. My shadow.   The selfies_ I look sadder and sicker in every one. Even the ones I took at moments before I was to go on stage or do something else public for my job (a big part of my work for years has been very public).  I started to get acne again - the other time I developed really severe acne was after I emigrated with him to Canada (he__ from here) and he had me isolated and under complete control after a concussion serious I suffered due to a bike accident.   Then the selfies stopped. There__ be the odd one I remember thinking I was coming out of the woods of burnout from my work but now I know it wasn__ work. It was him. It was the torture he put me through that I believed was my fault, that our relationship just needed work and it was all because of me for all the awful things he__ accuse me of that I knew weren__ true but I believed he must feel.  I still don__ really know if I could accept he did anything consciously despite how absolutely manipulative he was the entire 17 years_ but looking back at these moments in my photos with proper understanding has me realising, at the very least:  How utterly cruel that I was crying and pleading with him for so long but he__ rather keep torturing me (and himself) through endless conflicts and explosions. He__ rather keep being cruel and pushing me into emotional disarray to give him an excuse to get it all out on me than simply go get therapy like he always promised. He knowingly had us both suffering the worst either of us have in our lives just to avoid looking inward."

physical,Hurting the kids to hurt me,"I told him I didn't want to be with him anymore and he's been gone since Friday. He has been an hour away with his brother with our only vehicle. Well he's drinking again today and I don't see him safely making it home today if he drives. There is a long narrow bridge he would have to cross for 10-15 minutes. Which means the kids are going to miss school tomorrow. We don't have food and I have no way but to get there by walking my 3 kids (ages 3, 5, and 7) an hour away in 90_° heat. I don't want him here but I need the car to take care of the kids and that is how he is choosing to hurt me. He would rather the kids walk in 90_° heat than to give me the car. I fucking hate this man. He is a piece of shit who doesn't deserve these kids. Did I mention I fucking hate him because I do. I pray to never have to talk to him ever again, but know I can't. I just want to cry because the kids are being punished because of him and the 7 year old is getting old enough to really remember and form her own opinions.

physical,struggling to stay strong,"i usually just read people's post and never write anything but i figure what the hell.... I'm really struggling right now....  my late husband was my soulmate and he passed away in 2015.... i went on dating sites not looking for anything specific and last year i met this man who took my breath away. he said all the right things and we fell in love. inseparable and planned for the future. we've talked about getting married. he's had a difficult past with alcohol and drug struggles included but was doing well for the most part of our relationship and i was accepting as long as he was moving forward in life and not going back to the drugs and alcohol.  well 2 days ago.... he was drunk and threatened my life with a knife and hit me multiple times in the head and luckily my only injuries are a busted lip, and a ruptured eardrum. i called the cops and got him arrested. my anxiety is exponentially worse now that i know he posted bail late last night. he has been trying to contact me but i refuse to speak to him.... i will not subject myself to that. his messages are apologizing of course and apparently he thought he'd get out and I'd still be with him. so now that he knows that i want nothing to do with anymore, he is threatening suicide. my late husband died by suicide.... it's already a sensitive subject for me and he knows that. i feel bad that he is getting charged with felony corporal injury on a cohabitant but that's not my fault. he is an adult, and he makes his own choices. I'm realizing now that he definitely knows how to manipulate and i can't believe i fell for it. but i absolutely will not tolerate it.  as of now, i am ""hiding"" at family's house that he doesn't know where they live and still.... I'm an anxious wreck wondering if he'll look for me. anyways.... i don't know what the point of this post was.... i guess I'm just trying to vent what I'm trying to process in my head to help ease my anxiety and cope? i just don't know."
physical,Financial Abuse SUCKS!!!,I wanted to share a website that my therapist gave to me that her group is working on to help people escape toxic relationships.

emotional,I hate myself,"I was basically made to feel/told that I was/am worthless, a ""dummy"", not good enough etc. and I absolutely hate myself and totally believe these things. I've been in therapy for at least 20 years, on &amp; off, and I am not doing better. Has anyone ever gotten over this? I don't even know if it's possible for me at this point.  My emotional abuser offered to buy me a vehicle, said he saved up some money for it. I was given the impression that I would be able to choose. Basically, he chose for me &amp; the vehicle is okay. I should be grateful because it's a lot nicer than anything I could afford. But I am so depressed that I did not get to choose it. I think it's bringing up those feelings of powerlessness from my childhood. He's actually picked out all of my vehicles. I don't understand why I feel so terrible when this is a good thing for me. Maybe I'm just a really selfish &amp; spoiled person? I just feel totally worthless, like a failure. I've been crying on &amp; off. I usually just agree with his choices because I don't want to make him mad. Stay quiet, stay out of the way kind of mentality. I don't remember ever having been physically abused but you know, kind of constantly afraid of that. I don't live with my emotional abuser but see him often. I would love to hear your thoughts on this...maybe I'm just emotionally overwhelmed right now with everything going on."
physical,Pregnant and Protective Order Guilt,"I was granted a protective order by the judge as recommended by police who made multiple visits to our residence. I am worried about aftermath and feeling guilt for going this route. There have been multiple physical violence occurences as well as breaking items that belong to me. Unfortunately, I never called authorities during a physical occurence. I only called authorities once I became fed up and started noticing signs he would or could again become violent during rages or outbursts in hopes it would not escalate.  I am extremely early in pregnancy and considering abortion as well. The partner vascillates between telling me to abort (tells me it's not his and I must be cheating as well as I must be lying about pregnancy and tells me to abort) and to keep because he loves me. Please--no moral judgements. I just need some support for guilt for the order as well as consideration of abortion and maybe any advice.  The guilt, I feel, is stemming from the back and forth of him being the best person and also the worst. I am hoping to see clearly."
physical,Tw- violence I (34f) was choked by my now ex flbf (30m) and I can't make sense of it,"I was in a fairly new relationship w my bf when COVID hit (2 months) and we decided to quarantine together. We had said I love you and both of us felt like this could be the major relationship of our lives.  There were glimpses of emotional and verbal abuse from him (he'd wildly curse at me or ice me out and refuse affection or accuse me of being manipulative or controlling whenever I expressed things I didn't like,) but I thought we were moving passed this. One week he sat there and berated everything about me and I packed his things for him to go, but he ended up wanting to stay.  We talked to a therapist remotely.  We decided to take space while in the apartment bc of COVID and we had a great week where he gave me the affection I needed and I gave him the freedom to do his thing w video games. Then it exploded.   It started w him getting super angry and volatile over misusing the washing machine. I was on a work call, so I muted it and went to tell him he had put the machine on the wrong setting. He immediately got very nasty and defensive but I needed to finish my call so I left the room. After the call ended I went back to him where he proceeded to tell me to ""get the fuck"" out of his face and when I told him not to curse at me he kept yelling ""or what?!"" at me, standing up to like square up to me.  My only response was, you shouldn't talk to me like that because you should have respect for me and he told me he clearly doesn't. So I ended up sitting down on the floor, shaking, and he left the room. We did not speak for a full 24 hours.   I went out the next morning and got a long  text where he explained he felt stupid by me explaining the washing machine and that he's sure now that he's a self sabateur and he thought our relationship could truly work out and he loved me and he was sorry.  Noticing that he never acknowledged the cursing in my face, I wrote back a long thread about how I found the cursing and escalation to be unacceptable and disrespectful and I didn't want it. This did not go over well. He ended up texting me he was going to leave.  I told him, if he could not act with that basic level of respect he should go, because it's a deal breaker. I arrived home around this time, went upstairs and asked him why he was upset.  Tw-Violence He jumped up, grabbed me by the throat and threw me against my tall dresser and started kicking me. When I finally got free, I went for my phone which was still connected to a work conference call that he took from me, taunting me about calling the police. He then put me in a headlock and bodyslammed me to the floor on top of one of his computer monitors. I was shrieking bloody murder at this point, hoping one of my neighbors would call the police. When he finally let me go I grabbed my phone and texted my father, my 2 friends and a friend of his who lived around the block hoping one of them would call the police. I sat on the edge of the bed across the room to make sure he didn't steal anything from me.  The bf of his friend I texted called and my bf lied saying I wouldn't let him leave and that I was hitting him, to which I responded get the fuck out.  He ended up leaving, his friend ended up coming by and asking what happened, I told him, he helped my ex get his things and that was that. My dad arrived soon after to comfort me.  My issue now is that I cannot make sense of this. I don't get this. I don't get how someone attempts to strangle their partner not even an hour after they're telling them how much they love them. I met w my therapist the next day. I am still in shock. My heart hurts; this is not the first time I've dealt w partner violence and I already have PTSD from it, which my bf (now ex) knew about.  I can't wrap my head around loving someone and wanting to harm them. I can't understand the escalation. And the choking part makes me believe that this probably wasn't the first time he's been violent, because that's a step away from killing your partner.  Help me heal.   Tl;dr my partner choked me out of nowhere and i cant make sense of it to heal.  Edit: typos"
physical,Uplifting,"I was in a manipulative/abusive relationship for 20 months exactly. I left three weeks ago. My abuser always said that I didn__ have a soul because I was white. He always said that I would never find a prize as good as him.  I am in control of my mind!!!! I have power over myself &amp; can make my own choices. I can cause headaches &amp; cure them!!! My soul is GLOWING. My heart is becoming open more everyday. God is power.   A DV hotline lady, Emily, helped me once.

emotional,Is this abuse? I don't know anymore,"I was just recently diagnosed with CPTSD, bipolar 2, GAD, panic disorder and ADHD. I was emotionally abused by my mom until my early 20s. I was emotionally/spiritually abused by my mother in law which stopped last year when I went no contact.  I didn't realize I was emotionally abused by my mom until 2019 when I first started therapy.  I was emotionally/spiritually abused by my MIL for around 11 years until I went no contact. Again, it was someone telling me I was being emotionally/spiritually abused that I realized ok maybe that's what happened.  Since my diagnose, I feel like I've been spiraling even more. I constantly question if what my MIL did to me was actually something or am I making it up/making something out of nothing.  **A list of some things she has done:**  * Told me multiple times to quit my job (graphic designer) and do what she thinks I should be doing (illustrator) even though I have told her that is just a hobby and have never wanted to make a career out of it * She joked that when we had children, they wouldn't be mine - they would be hers * Told me god gave me chronic pain/depression/etc because he knew I could handle it * Has guilted me when I didn't want to drive to another state to spend the weekend at my SIL's house. Have told her multiple times it's hard for me to travel with chronic pain. I also didn't want to go cause they would force me to go to church, but I never told her that * Had invaded my sex life with her son when we were younger (20 years old) and told me there was something wrong with me because I did not have any guilt over having sex before marriage. Told us to stop even though we were adults and gave us a book on why we are being sinners * Gave me a binder that had 50 pages in it trying to answer my struggles over religion. She had written most of it, but had gotten her pastor to contribute to it too.  * Told me I had her son whipped and that he does way too much for me. I think she said that because she believes the husband is the head of the household, while me and my spouse have an equal relationship * Rarely apologizes, and if she does it's always ""if"" ""but"" * She was mad that we were coming home a certain weekend because she said we knew her work schedule and did it on purpose so we wouldn't have to see her as much. I stood up for myself because it was my dad's birthday and I had no clue what her work schedule was as it changed a lot. I felt instant regret and apologized, she ignored me while I followed her around wishing she would forgive me. Very similar to my mom and her silent treatments  * I have told her multiple times about my depression, chronic pain etc but will act shocked when I say how much pain I am in. ""You never told me it was that bad""  * Has said insensitive things about depression/suicide in front of me - they are weak, selfish and sick in the head * When my husband and I were on our honeymoon, she told us that her and her husband would spend their nights watching us move around on an app that tracked our location * This one is very hard to admit. I have such shame over it. After one surgery, I was really out of it and had to go bathroom. The nurse told me she would wipe me as I was weak and they were worried about the stitches in that area. MIL said she would do it because she is a nurse. And she did. And I didn't stop her. Why didn't I stop her.   **Some more backstory, but very long:**  I met my MIL when I was still being emotionally abused by my mom. When I first met her, I thought she was so nice and loving. She loves her kids - she actually hugs them - maybe she will love me and I will have the mom I never had. As I got to know her, I learned that was not going to be the case. She is very black and white, it's either this is good or this is bad. No in-between. You have to believe in everything she believes in otherwise there is no love.   I got told I need to be a ""good christian woman"" and when I got married it was a ""good christian wife"" and ""don't you want to do that for your husband?"" One time, I had mentioned I liked to think that it didn't matter if you did or didn't believe in something, as long as you tried your best and treated others well - you would go to heaven. It was early on in the relationship and I thought it was ok to share your opinions. She snapped at me, yelled at me for telling lies and that is not what god or the bible says. Told me only christians go to heaven and everyone spends an eternity in hell so you better believe and you better save others. She was already being passive aggressive towards me at this point, but I think it was then I saw her true side. I still tried. I went to church, I tried to read the bible. Everything in my head was screaming no but I tried. I wanted to be loved.  In college, I was at my breaking point. The thought of religion and fear of hell was eating away at me. I was in a deep depression. I tried to force myself to believe, and in reality I didn't even want to because of the racism/homophobia/sexium I saw in that family/church. I guess I just wanted to please her. Finally, I accepted I was agnostic and that was ok (I still struggled with fear but I was in a better place).  I was humiliated in front of my husband's family members because I wasn't christian. Last year, I found out she and some of the family were praying for me to finally see the light and change. I thought ok this is my time to stand up for myself. I took all my courage and sent an email talking about my depression and how trying to force myself to believe only ended up with me even deeper in my depression. I told her I knew she was coming from a place of love (I still wanted her to accept me) but if she could please refrain from trying to change me/convert me etc. I showed my husband to make sure I wasn't being mean or hurtful. I really thought she would listen and understand. She didn't. She replied with a long email with tons of bible quotes and how I was going to hell. She said she just wanted me to know the relationship she has with god.   At the end of it she said, ""By the way, some people could say that the way you view __eligion_ and how you can't agree with His teachings could mean that you think I'm stupid for believing in Him, gullible, and that there is something __rong with me_. I choose not to think that is what you think of me and instead you respect my choice of belief and you need to understand that I don't think there is anything wrong with you because you struggle to believe or just plain don't believe. I love you and I always will.""  My heart is pounding, my head is swimming. How is me saying that I struggled with good people going to hell means I think she is stupid? I never once told her she needs to change her beleifs. Never criticized her religion except the time I gave my opinion. There is nothing wrong with me but I'm going to hell to suffer forever?  I asked her again, please stop this isn't about your beliefs - this is about my mental health. She replied saying ok I get it. I will never mention my beliefs again and I am sorry for the hurt I apparently continue to cause. Still frustrated but whatever, she said she was done. Then another email comes. Saying no, I will not stop and I will always pray for you to know the love of god because jesus loves you and he died for you.  I still tried to have a relationship with her after that. It wasn't until she did this small petty thing that I said no more. I am done.  My husband and I have tried to set boundaries before or talk to her about her treatment of me, but it was always met with either yelling or tears. One time in college, she showed up unannounced to our apartment. We set the boundary of you can't just show up - please ask us first. She sent me a text saying ""sorry if I upset you, I guess I just can't surprise my little boy anymore."" My SO then told her don't ever talk to her like that again and we need some time. Well that time lasted till the next day because she was crying all night, had to leave work early because she couldn't stop crying and I had to accept her apology. My husband has struggled with standing up to her and staying strong about boundaries.  We both went no contact. He fully realized the extent of her behavior. She did a lot of things to me in private or around people who enabled her, and he didn't see it in the beginning. We are still struggling with other family members telling us to just let it go and even was told she is dumb and you just need to accept that she says the wrong things. ""Don't let it get to you"" Also have been told she has changed.   My mom and my MIL had similar childhoods. Both had alcoholic parents, both were emotionally abused and possibly physically as well.   I felt like I was constantly trying to please her, over analyzed everything I said to her in fear that I hurt her and just so badly wanted to be accepted by her.   I am sorry this is so long, I want reassurance that I'm not making something out of nothing. I feel so crazy about everything and just wonder if I can't handle anything.  TL;DR My MIL constantly made me feel like shit for not being a good christian woman. I confronted her about my depression being triggered by religion and she told me I was going to hell. My husband and I have gone no contact and I am dealing with the question was it really emotional abuse?"
physical,"Missing comfort object, AITA?","I was physically abused by my older brothers from the time I was 10 to 13, and have always been emotionally abused by my entire family. My brothers when they got angry over any little thing would chase me to hit me, which would often lead me to running to my room trying to close the door, but they were 4 and 5 years older than me so they were always able to push it open and then hurt me. Instead of my father addressing the issue he put a lock on my door, allowing me to keep them out as needed which never fixed the issue, and just gave me a place to run to. Fast forward, I'm 20 now and despite having moved out of the house, when I go to visit I will not go to sleep without locking the door to my old room.  I grew up sometimes triple checking the lock to ensure they couldn't attack me. So after a long drive to visit said father, I get to my room only to find that the lock is missing and the response I get from my father is ""who cares"" which made me go into meltdown mode, freaking out and saying I'm heading back to my apartment to which he didn't care after a long drive to see him. He knows just how important it is to me to have the lock on the door, and after having a bit of a meltdown as it was not only for the lock, but having to be around other toxic people that do not respect boundaries he physically attacked me:( he shoved my head, and then threatened to cut me off, not the first time he's attacked me either as he once wrapped his hands around my neck at another point in time. After a while I find the lock outside my room on the window seal so there was no way, it fell off. Someone took it off,  and placed it where it could not easily be seen which was initially part of what I was saying in my meltdown. To sum this up, I don't feel safe in my family's home without having my room locked and my dad knows this, but did not care and chose to be physical instead of helping me find it. AITA?"

physical,Scammed by a person pretending to be a victim of DV on Reddit,"I was this past week scammed by a person who posts in this forum /constantshit posted recently about leaving an abusive partner.   They have then been posting across several city subreddits scamming people out of money saying themselves and their child are unable to access food. Several cities across the UK.   Myself and a few others in my city jumped to help and sent this person vouchers only for it to then become clear a few days later that it was a scam when I looked up this account to see how they were.  The post was particularly emotive for me as I was a victim of domestic abuse and had a young baby at the time, just as this person said.   Anyway please watch out for it. It__ awful to think people are using this subject to scam others."

emotional,I__ so confused,"I was verbally abusive. She was emotionally abusive. So why do I want back in? Why do I want to get back with someone who threatened to commit suicide when they didn__ mean it? Why would I expect her to want to be with me, someone who would say awful things during fights? Someone who punched a TV like a spoiled brat. Someone who would text bomb while angry.   I felt like I was in a relationship where I__ do pretty nasty shit to her, and she__ do pretty bad things to me. Nasty being worse than bad.  Example: I__ beg and cry for her not to touch me during arguments. She__ keep trying to hug me. I__ push her away.  That__ nasty on my part.  Bad on her part would be her constant belittlement of my character. To the point where I went from writing at least 200-300 pages a year to about 15. Bad on her.  Or trying to choke me with her tiny hands (which today is still a hilarious image). I__ scream, she__ yell.   But as you see, mine outweighs the bad. So am I allowed to say I was emotionally abused when I myself was no better? Am I even allowed to feel bad for the trauma she inflicted upon me despite the trauma i gave her being deeper? Example: I am deathly afraid of spending money and treating myself because while we dated, I was dirt poor. She made me feel awful for it. Every. Day.  Now that I am significantly not poor, I still feel like the poor piece of shit she made me to feel. Hell, I only eat out ONCE a week...at Mcdonald__. And I still get panic attacks because I have images of her yelling at me about not spending money. She__ even do it in public in front of strangers.  I go to the cheapest option of food even though I can afford better, which is 100% due to how she treated me. And even then, said panic attacks ensue. If I go through that, there is no telling what she goes through due to my own shitty/nasty/embarassing/gross behavior.   I asked her back. She said no. Obviously. I__ embarrassed that I would even attempt such an unwise move. Of the massive letter I wrote her. I have numerous stories of her emotional abuse. Should I write them down to remind me it wasn__ just I who was a sith? I was a sith lord for sure. She was just a sith apprentice.  I know how terrible I was. Sometimes I forget her transgressions.   PS. We met on christmas. Fuck spending this holiday alone.    PPS. Sorry for the ramble. I__ sad."
emotional,I__ so confused,"I was verbally abusive. She was emotionally abusive. So why do I want back in? Why do I want to get back with someone who threatened to commit suicide when they didn__ mean it? Why would I expect her to want to be with me, someone who would say awful things during fights? Someone who punched a TV like a spoiled brat. Someone who would text bomb while angry.   I felt like I was in a relationship where I__ do pretty nasty shit to her, and she__ do pretty bad things to me. Nasty being worse than bad.  Example: I__ beg and cry for her not to touch me during arguments. She__ keep trying to hug me. I__ push her away.  That__ nasty on my part.  Bad on her part would be her constant belittlement of my character. To the point where I went from writing at least 200-300 pages a year to about 15. Bad on her.  Or trying to choke me with her tiny hands (which today is still a hilarious image). I__ scream, she__ yell.   But as you see, mine outweighs the bad. So am I allowed to say I was emotionally abused when I myself was no better? Am I even allowed to feel bad for the trauma she inflicted upon me despite the trauma i gave her being deeper? Example: I am deathly afraid of spending money and treating myself because while we dated, I was dirt poor. She made me feel awful for it. Every. Day.  Now that I am significantly not poor, I still feel like the poor piece of shit she made me to feel. Hell, I only eat out ONCE a week...at Mcdonald__. And I still get panic attacks because I have images of her yelling at me about not spending money. She__ even do it in public in front of strangers.  I go to the cheapest option of food even though I can afford better, which is 100% due to how she treated me. And even then, said panic attacks ensue. If I go through that, there is no telling what she goes through due to my own shitty/nasty/embarassing/gross behavior.   I asked her back. She said no. Obviously. I__ embarrassed that I would even attempt such an unwise move. Of the massive letter I wrote her. I have numerous stories of her emotional abuse. Should I write them down to remind me it wasn__ just I who was a sith? I was a sith lord for sure. She was just a sith apprentice.  I know how terrible I was. Sometimes I forget her transgressions.

physical,Worst flashback to date.,"I was visiting my boyfriend over the weekend and ended up getting drunk. I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety, ptsd symptoms, insomnia, and flashbacks since I left my abuser so alcohol was probably not a good idea.  Anyways, my boyfriend said something to me that made me upset. It was not mean or malicious or with bad intentions in the slightest. I was just drunk and emotional and started crying a little bit while I was laying on the bed.  He asked me to tell him what he did that made me upset. I didn't want to tell him because I didn't want him to feel bad for my issues.  He came over to the bed and got over top of me, in a loving manner, to ask again what was wrong, and in that moment I was back to my abuser pinning me down, knees on my arms, screaming in my face.  I yelled ""I'm sorry"" to my boyfriend and burst into tears.  My adrenaline surged to the levels they were at during the times I was abused and the flashbacks took over my brain. I couldn't stop crying and couldn't control my emotions. I was trapped in that space and time in my head and couldn't shake it. My boyfriend was very supportive, but I was embarrassed and concerned that there will be more flashbacks like that in the future.  I know I need to find a therapist.  I just wanted to post here and see if anyone else has dealt with these and if there is any advice that might be helpful to me.  I did tell my boyfriend the next day after I calmed down and sobered up what triggered me and he thanked me for telling him so that he can avoid it in the future.  He tells me not to beat myself up but sometimes I feel so broken and like I'm projecting my problems on him even though they just come out sometimes and I can't control it."
physical,What does it mean?,"I was with a man I am dating last night. He started to choke and slap me lightly while we were kissing. Normally, I like this because dominance turns me on. However, the slapping got harder and harder. I had to tell him not to hurt me. We got in his car and started making out. He forced me to take my clothes off and I told him no, so he grabbed my bra and pulled my boobs out. At one point, he asked me if I__ ever let a guy fart in my face and I said no. He told me he was going to do this to me and was literally grabbing me trying to force it. The only reason he stopped is because I mentioned that someone was watching us and would call the cops if they saw what was happening. I__ just wondering what the general reaction to this by others is. I do think this is a toxic relationship and that he__ abusive. He violated my boundaries and low key sexually assaulted me. Should I address this with him or just go no contact?"
emotional,WAS THIS EMOTIONAL ABUSE ? He made me feel like crap for not having sex with him again!!,"I was with my ex boyfriend for almost 2 years he NEVER told me he loved me during our relationship and was always breaking up with me for dumb shit and then taking me back , he would call me __ental bitch_ and other mean names &amp; would make fun of the fact that I couldn__ drive because of my panic attacks/ ptsd ( from a bad car accident) , one time he even had sex with me when I was passed out drunk (basically rape) anyways we finally broke up in Dec 2017 ( because he had a new girlfriend a week later and was bragging about it to me and sending me pics of her ugly ass ) so the summer of 2019 he hits me up wanting me to be his fuck buddy I cursed him out cause I couldn__ believe he caused me so much pain in our relationship just to come back to me just to fuck!! ( &amp; plus it was right before my birthday when he made this offer he literally said _ atleast you__l have a good birthday if you fuck me _) Anyways long story short when I finally gave in to the idea of being his FWB he and told me __ ruined it for him and I don__ turn him on anymore and I should have fucked him when he first asked_ now 2 years later I__ still depressed over it cause my birthday is coming up and I__ still reminded of this bullshit I and beat myself up for not being his FWB after our breakup I can__ even make myself have sex with anyone I feel ugly &amp; useless and while he__ off living in Florida now happy and I__ stuck here depressed/ miserable.. he was able to move a state away and move on AND I CANT SMH HELP ME?!?"
physical,How do i heal? (TW:Abuse),"I was with my ex for a little over a year. Background info i__ 16F and he__ 18M. i was 15 when we started dating and it was amazing he found me at a really low point and brought me out of it, it was the first time i truly felt like i was loved. He was sweet and caring and very compassionate about my past (sexual abuse, family trauma, mental health struggles) He truly made me feel loved and cared for.  Everything was good up until 3 months after we started dating. More background info he was a virgin when we met and i was not, and he did know about the basics of my past before we started dating just no details. After we hit around 3 months he started questioning my past  like asking for the tiniest details which was ok at first because although i hated myself for my past i loved him and felt safe telling him. It progressively got worse as time went on because he would ask the same questions over and over but would now get mad at my responses even tho they were the same as before claiming i lied before which i did not. Things got really bad when after 4 months i told him about a potential r@pe i was intoxicated and do not recall a thing even tho i always remember when i drink up until i fall asleep. i did not tell him at first because it was something i was unsure about and also scared to admit. He got angry with me and started to yell at me saying things like how do you not remember and alla that.  He would always bring it up asking well what were you wearing what convo did you have before you stopped remembering and just small details.  This is where it all started to go downhill.  Right after our 6 month anniversary he started to bring up a threesome idea which i was sorta into because i was bi-questioning. We talked about it a bit and i got even more into it until he brought up the fact that it would __elp him move on from my past_ which started to hurt me and make me feeling more shameful about my past then i was before. Long story short he planned a threesome and i backed out because i got scared, i was still 15 btw. He told me he was still going to sleep with this girl because it would help him heal. I repeatedly said no that__ cheating i__ not comfortable until he started to threaten me saying __ can__ get over your past it__ not fair to me i deserve this we aren__ going to last long term if i don__ do this_ then went on to say __he__ leaving in a month i__l never see her again, it__ my last opportunity_ after me saying give me some time to think. That night he went out and fucked her then called me crying saying he regretted it.  This is where it all got bad, we started to argue and fight a lot, i was damaged and hurting all the time. He tried to break up with me __ut couldn__ do it_ because i was still upset about him cheating a month after.  He had put his hands on me but i never thought much into it because i thought he was just joking like the time where i joked about my bloated stomach being a baby and he punched it. Or when he punched a hole in his door saying __hat could have been your face, watch the way you act around me_ after me playfully hitting him for saying he was ugly.  It got so bad that he would try to break up with me like once a week and as soon as he saw me cry he would say oh never mind but you need to fix your negativity or you need to work on this. The fights were always bad it would usually ending me crying on my drive home or me leaving is house. I felt so worthless and brought down and he made me feeling like no one else would love me because i had a sexual past. Towards the end he would only really show me love when he wanted sex. His family had planned a vacation right after our 1 year anniversary and i went with them this is where it hit its worse. We were already at really high tension because of all the fighting and me begging him to love me and show me the affection he did in the beginning. Towards the end of the trip after days of fighting he started to question my past again, this time my potential r@pe. It triggered thoughts of my childhood abuse and i had a panic attack. He was angry and getting aggressive so i locked myself in the bathroom of our room. I turned off the lights and sat in the bathroom closet (dark confined spaces comfort my panic attacks). He gets into the bathroom and opens the closet door to a still panicking me. i wasn__ able to talk because i felt like i couldn__ breathe and i was crying hard. He was yelling at this point saying tell me what__ wrong with you, and getting aggressive again i got scared and tried to push past him because i felt cornered, he then grabbed me by my neck slammed me into the door and said don__ you fucking walk away from me. I got sent into a tailspin and ran out the door crying. He never apologized only said idk why you act like that. The trip ended a day after that and we left. He started to distance himself from me and i felt myself detaching from him finally. We __ook some space_ until he eventually left me saying i was too much. We ended on good terms but i was heartbroken and traumatized when i started to realize how controlling and toxic he was to me. A week after we broke up he started texting me horrible messages saying how i__ a horrible person and a pos and how he wishes he could kill me and never talk to me again. I__ really stuck on how to heal because the events from all of that affect me now trying to move on and be ok with myself and trust other men again."
emotional,Medical abuse?,"I wasn__ really sure how to title this. I haven__ slept yet so please disregard any poor grammar etc.   My mum is a narcissist who mentally, emotionally &amp; financially abused me when I was a child. My dad_whilst he tried to question my mum__ behaviour, he didn__ really do anything to stop it.   There has been a few times in the past when I have taken an over the counter remedy and had a really bad reaction to it. When I have told my parents about it, I__e been informed that I was allergic to it and I should have already known about it, complete with stories from my childhood about the reactions I__ had and how they stopped giving me these remedies. They also never took me to the doctors about this so there is nothing in my medical records.   There are huge black spots in my childhood memories because I can__ remember or I__e buried traumatic things so I__ not sure how I__ supposed to remember getting violently sick from something easily accessible in any chemist.   Recently I went for blood work due to suffering from severe anxiety/mental health problems &amp; I wanted to make sure there wasn__ a medical reason for it. Thankfully there isn__, I__ just crazy. However, something was picked up that was a concern enough that I need to take medication to control it. My doctor asked me some questions about my parents health as it__ hereditary and at the time, I answered in the negative. After getting off the phone, I googled the condition and yes, it is hereditary and it can only be picked up during routine blood tests.   You can probably guess what happened next. I spoke to my parents about the medication and my mum said they are both on the same medication for the same condition and __ thought you knew!_.   Well, no, mum, had I known, I would have done something about it sooner!   So is this common behaviour for emotionally abusive parents?"
physical,I__e been in denial,"I went a little MIA on this sub shortly after my incident occurred. My friends tell me I__ talking about it like it happened to a friend, my therapist is trying to work through how I disassociate but everything feels so overwhelming. I can__ make myself see or believe this happened to me. The love of my life punched me. Feelings are so complicated and it__ not black and white for me. I keep downplaying everything__ he__ done. He__ thrown a water and water bottle at me. Slapped me. Then almost punched me. Then punched me. He went to a strip club and paid for oral and gave me chlamydia.He wants nothing to do with me and I feel like I__ being punished and that at any moment he will come back. How did he hurt me and then completely discard me? I don__ want to spend me life with him I__ (21F) and I know this isn__ the life I__e imagined for myself. I__ in my senior year in college and this is affected my school, my future, and now it__ without him. I__e never had to be alone and being dependent on someone who hurt me sounds terrible logically but it__ all I__e known. We__e been apart for 3 weeks but he still is in control of my life without even trying. How do I get it back? How can I see this happened to ME? Before this ruins my life."
emotional,Went to my first therapy appointment,"I went in scared to open up, but came out with a bit of a clearer mind set. She confirmed what I had suspected: ya girl is traumatized. But I__ gonna be workin through it one step at a time. Just remember that healing takes time and what works for someone else might not necessarily work for you. Love y__ll, this sub has been so supportive of me __"
emotional,Looking for advice - male abuse,"I will try to keep this short.    My brother has been in a relationship for over 15 years. His now wife has systematically isolated him from all his friends and nearly all his family.    There is a lot of evidence of emotional and financial abuse and he has left her more than once only for her to manipulate and pull him back in. I've had to cut  myself away for the sake of my kids, I can't risk her toxicity around them.   We're based in the UK is there any ideas people have for how we could help him come out of the FOG?  Thanks for reading!"
physical,I recently found out that my friend of several years (now we're in early 20s) has been abused by their (to protect our identities) father.,"I won't specify anything else about us (genders, ages, nationality, nothing).  They've always been very silent, introverted, uptight and shy... But only recently, I found out that they're been horribly abused for years, if not their whole life. He yells at them for no good reason, sometimes even slaps them, threatens them, he once even threw them from their apartment, so they had to live with grandparents for a month.  So their father is really violent and it scares me, how they can take it.  They tell me, that they doesn't want to tell it to the police or to solve it in any way, because it would only cause problems and produce nothing positive.  I can't help them in any way, but I'm afraid for them.  Is there anything I can do?"
physical,"For those of you that have spent time in a DV shelter, what kinds of things mads it a more positive experience?","I work for a DV org and we're trying to make experiences more helpful and enjoyable. We know it's quite possibly the most challenging time in people's lives, and we want to do what we can to help."
emotional,What would you ask the person who was abusive towards you if you could ask anything?,"I would ask what my father passed away from.  Because it was when he passed away that I realised he really only thought about himself, and wasn't clued in at all to my life."
emotional,Should I send this letter?,"I wrote this letter to get my feelings off my chest and now I want to send it but I don't know if I should. It would be on paper in an envelope left at his door. I genuinely don't believe that it would change his mind about his behavior or have any real effect. I'm not even sure if it'll help me feel better, but it might. Should I send it?  The letter:   I'm sure you still think that you're a good person but I want you to know that you're not, and I'm sure that won't mean anything to you because you'll never understand all of the pain that you caused me and still continue to cause me. You never have and likely never will have to face the consequences of all those things you did.  When I look back at our time together I do not remember it fondly. I am still haunted by the way that you treated me.   What I experienced with you was not love. It was violence. It was control. It was manipulation.   It was abuse.   You may believe that you got better towards the end, however it wasn't just your outbursts that were abusive. It was also all the ways that you convinced me that your actions were my fault and that I deserved your anger.  I was constantly afraid that you would hit me. But you never even had to. What I should've been afraid of was all the ways you were able to hurt me without ever leaving a mark.  You isolated me from everyone and everything good in my life until you were all that I had left. You were angry with my parents because they didn't trust you. You were angry with my friend because she was on to you. You were angry with me because I knew. I learned to excuse and ignore the way that you treated me at the time because it was all that I had, and all that I could even imagine life to be.   You had a habit of blaming everyone but yourself for your poor behavior, and I want you to know that the painful experiences of your past were never an excuse for treating me the way that you did. I hope that you understand that what you did was abuse. I spent so much time being afraid of you. It has and will continue to be a long journey to recover from you.   You may find this hard to accept and you may even think that I'm being dramatic or remembering things incorrectly, but this is the truth and you need to hear it. And I hope you accept it, but that's a choice that only you can make.    I had a hard time accepting it as well. When I was with you, I doubted myself - I doubted my character, my memory, my sanity, as you convinced me time and time again that I was wrong.   All of my thoughts and feelings were beholden to you.  And even now, I'm still trying to recover what I lost over those years.  You're not a good person who's done bad things. You're a bad person who's done irredeemable damage to others.   I want to say that I forgive you, but I don't"
emotional,I'm losing sight of what's normal in a relationship. Please help,"I(33f) live with my partner (35m) in London. We are well travelled, well educated (both masters degree and above) and come from educated families from the Indian subcontinent.   We got married 3 years ago and even before we got married he was very possessive. I chalked it down to his previous gf of 9 years repeatedly cheating on him and him not having any support to deal with it. I made the classic mistake of trying to rescue a nice guy in a bad emotional place. Once we got married, literally the week we moved in together we had an argument and he kicked me out of bed. It was too late for me to escape. We had just signed our marriage certificate in the court house and the big Asian wedding was coming up. Long story short he abused me for a while year with pushing and shoving and not allowing me to have a job or friends or anything. There we times I though the head banging would like me. He always liked to hurt me. And he would call me a sl*t a wh*re a b***h and so much more. Mind you this is at me, a person whose passion and education is in gender equality. So I was fully aware it was wrong. I tried getting help from his mum early on but she pretty much behaved shocked asked him to swear he wouldn't do it and then just reminded him of his promise.   Eventually I decided to bring my parents in and they worked in a manner that supported our marriage and not either of us individually. I was let down but I was also thinking that it's seems better to work at this than give up because apart from the abuse he is a good guy. I am fully aware how that sounds and I know it's something that victims of abuse often say.  While there was one respite, the abuse didn't stop. He would regularly corner me, call me names but at least he stopped spitting at me and allowed me to go out and join a few progress and meet a few people. But it didn't stop and I was so tired of being submissive . One day when he cornered me again and tried to shove me, I took the broom and hit him with it. He threw me across the room and I came back for more. I swear in my eyes I look like a superhero in that scene. I had detached any emotional affection. He kept shoving me I kept coming back and eventually I broke the broom. He realized I was serious about him stopping.  About a month later he tried to intimidate me again and said I better not humiliate him by doing something . I don't even remember what. I was so upset. I had given up everything at this point, everything to a point where i was shameless . (When he told me once that all the clothes I have on are bought by him and the house I live in is paid for by him, I took of my clothes and he threw me outside the house. So yes I gave up everything. Every sense of pride, ego, self respect . Everything. ) And I felt so betrayed that he thought I would humiliate him. And something broke in me. I locked myself in my bathroom and cut off my hair with very visible damage. When he opened the door I said, this is the only thing that can humiliate you. I broke down and eventually I found my self a therapist.   She was amazing and worked with me for the better part of a year and also encouraged me to ask him to get support.   But the emotional abuse hasn't stopped. It's up and down. I feel very controlled and lost. For example he calls me names all the time. He calls me selfish and lazy and I'm neither of those. I'm like an energiser bunny and enjoy keeping busy. He called me lazy because I couldn't find money in his wallet in the back of a dark cab. He called me selfish because I ate my food before him and to him name calling is a joke. His mum does it all the time to her husband (he was abusive to her for years before she became the abuser)   And yesterday I was watching the time travellers wife while he was sleeping in the evening. It was emotional and I was missing my childhood and my parents and my pre married life.Thining if I could turn back time. So I was sniffling and crying (and that's another thing I can't make a noise when I'm by myself . I can't dance, exercise or sing without drawing criticism for even the floor board creaking ) I guess I got used to being quiet in my house. I don't know if this is home any more ...  He wakes up, out of his nap storms into the living room . Asks me why I'm crying, I looked at the tv . He asks me to stop, I try to and then he switches the tv off. I had no choice . I felt so betrayed and let down. I just went straight to bed and have been here for 24 hours since. Since we have gotten together I've a multitude of health problems. I've been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression, I have added weight and now I have thyroid issues for which I have no genetic causes and it's been diagnosed as stress related.  I'm losing sense of reality. What does a normal relationship look like ?  Did you get health problems after you got married? Is that normal?"

physical,Am I the bad one for leaving?,"I__ (f 33) getting ready to secretly leave my boyfriend (m 23) and the guilt is eating me alive.   We__e been together for over 3 years and it started like a fairytale. Sometimes I still think he is my soulmate and I am throwing away the only man who will ever get me. Sometimes he still is the sweetest person on earth.  But one year into the relationship he changed or showed his real face. He has uncontrollable anger outbursts because of his unmedicated ADHD where he yells, says disrespectful things and punches furniture or home appliances until they are in shreds. He punches so hard he either breaks his bones or scratches his skin so badly it bleeds. He says he would never hit me. Or harm me. But he harms me with the yelling already but he doesn__ see it that way. He refuses to go to therapy and doesn__ want to change.  6 months ago we moved into a rented house together. He sweet talked me into it and promised he would pay half the rent. So far, I am paying all the rent and he keeps telling me __ext month_ he__l start paying but he doesn__. The rent is so expensive that it__ more than half my salary, leaving me with no money to pay my debt or go to a doctor. He doesn__ help around the house but criticizes me for not keeping it tidy. I work full time and have ADHD too, chores have always been a big challenge for me but he knew that before. I also pay all of his other expenses like food. He works sporadically and he invests his salary into his startup (which is now failing so there won__ be any incoming money for him to give me). He now decided to start another company and he__ now 50k in debited to his friends.   Now I also found out that he intends to make money __or us to live a better life_ by growing weed in our basement! This is illegal where we live and I am absolutely against it.   I told him I want to move out because I don__ want anything to do with that mess and I miss having time for myself and I am walking on eggshells everyday with him because any little inconvenience makes him explode and it__ aways my fault.   He says if I move out now I will be destroying his life because he can__ afford the rent for the house but he needs the house to grow weed. He said if I destroy his life then he will destroy mine. He has ties to organized crime and I am scared to death.   Am I cruel if I run away and go to a DV shelter and leave him behind with a messy house full of my stuff? I don__ see another way out but I don__ want to destroy him_I just want out!   Is this all my fault?"
emotional,Triggered by everything,"I__ 11 weeks out from husband admitting he cheated, giving me __pace_ (abandoned us for the weekend) and then trying to demand his way home while not being honest or ending the relationship so I tossed him.  The emotional abuse has gone on unknowingly since we met in 2002 and it got worse immediately after he discarded me and now we are separated as he continues cheating and not communicating.  We will be divorcing but I am not ready and I recognize that I have been psychologically and financially abused and sexually coerced for our 17.5 year marriage.  We have two children, trying everything to protect their hearts and minds and support them and not be subjected to any more mind games by their father.  Two weeks ago, my uncle who I__e been partly assisting with medical care and cancer treatments/appointments ended his fight with liver cancer so I__ grieving the loss of my best friend as we got very close, and last week my boy cat was deathly sick.  So I keep getting beaten down by life and now just doing anything remotely challenging leaves me sobbing.  Need to pick up prescriptions?  Break down in the car after?

emotional,Is there any way I can seek help from another country?,"I__ 16 years old, I have little sister and we are both getting psychologically abused on a daily basis. I don__ know about my sister but I get anxiety every day. Every dinner time, I always get anxious no matter what__ happening. I have seen my sister get mistreated the way I was when I was younger and everyday, it gets worse and worse. I was thinking of waiting it out until I have the chance to move out to canada for college but I can__ just sit and witness my sister get abused on a daily basis. I know how she__l turn out and I don__ have the emotional and physical capacity to try to be there for her as I just can__ deal with how she__ coping with it and it gives me more anxiety.   I know I need to seek help from services but honestly, I don__ trust anything from this country.   The standards of everything here is so low and underwhelming. I was thinking if there was a way to get help from another country for emotional abuse."
emotional,Is this emotional abuse or am I catastrophizing?,"I__ 20 years old and a full time student so usually live at my student address, I do however work in my hometown on the weekend so I train down and spend 2 nights at home in the week (one at my parents house and one at my boyfriends parents house). My mother drives me down to the station at the end of the weekend (though I told her it__ fine as I don__ expect her to) and on the car rides she screams at me the entire way about how I use her as a taxi service, and I spend too much time with my boyfriend (who I__e been with for 4 years) and it__ selfish of me to spend a night at his when she drives me to the train station every week (please note again that I told her she doesn__ have to and I__ more than happy to get there myself as it isn__ a hard journey).   A few weeks ago she texted me at work and asked when my lunch break was, and that she needed to talk to me. She then locked me in her car in a car park and told me I wasn__ looking after myself and I looked homeless (I have naturally curly hair and stopped straightening it recently to care for my texture better) and gave me shampoo and body lotion to __ake me look normal_ (I also have stress triggered eczema) she told me I was obviously on drugs and needed to sort my life out. I had an anxiety attack and she told me to get out and go back to work.   In the house when I__ home I cook dinner, clean up during the day, take the bins, etc. I also obviously have essays to write and exams to study for so I do this in between, if one of my parents come home when I__ sitting down they yell at me about how they work all day and i treat their house like a hotel and get in the way, yet if I stay with my boyfriend for a day then I__ __reeloading_ and selfish for not being with family.   A lot of the time my parents don__ remember questionable things they did, when I was a kid my mother made me get my ears pierced (otherwise I wouldn__ be pretty like other little girls) and they got severely infected. She took the earrings out and immediately tried to put new ones in, which was too painful and I begged her to just leave it and I__ get them pierced again after and she shut me in my room for 2 days for being ungrateful (she brought me breakfast and dinner). When I brought this up she said that it never happened, though when this happened, she took me to my friends house where her mum was able to gently put non backed earrings in my ears and she remembers the whole event.   Both parents also drink a lot. They get through a bottle of gin/vodka/wine (depends on what they feel like) an evening and are consistently drunk and hungover. They play loud music over 6 speakers across the house when I__ studying and if I ask them to turn it down they pretend they can__ hear me and call me a buzzkill.   I__ overall very uncomfortable in my parents house, but due to the pandemic I__ stuck here as we__e in lockdown. When I had the escape of my student house and my boyfriends I could just about cope but it__ getting increasingly worse."
emotional,Advice for living with emotionally abusive parents?,"I__ 20 years old and I__ college. I__e been in therapy for the past year although I__e had to hide it from my parents and since being in therapy my eyes have been opened to the abuse that my parents do to me. Some people have said that my dad has traits similar to that of a narc and I__e noticed all the control my parents want to have over me. Every time I try to google for answers I only find people who are out of the abusive relationship and not advice for those who are in it. So that__ what I__ asking for. Since my parents are still supporting me financially I feel obligated to accept the abuse. I__ also the youngest child so I have seen how bad things have gotten for my sisters when they stood up to him and already my situation is bad but not as bad as my sisters. They keep telling me to stick up for myself but I am so scared to. I said I__ going to therapy without my parents knowledge and that is true however they did pay for it for a few weeks but didn__ think my therapist knew was she was doing. In order for them to pay for it they wanted me to send them a diet and exercise log every week, since I didn__ do that they stopped paying. My entire life my dad has called me a brat for having any other emotion other than happy. Now he__ convinced I have depression and if I__ not depressed then I have to be just acting like a spoiled brat who isn__ getting what they want. I__ forced to be home for every break and I have to come home once a month when I__ at school and I tried working a lot this past summer but my parents say I__ avoiding them so I feel like I can__ do anything but be around them all the time. My parents make comments about my clothes, weight, hair, personality, and talks bad about my boyfriends family and my dad also tells me about how he resents my mom. I used to be oblivious to all this and now I__ not. I have 4 more weeks left living with them this summer but two of those weeks I__l be on a trip with no escape. I__ exhausted and I__ not good at pretending to be happy when I__ not.   Anybody have any tips to deal with them when I am home. How to mask my true feelings and what to do when I__ forced to be around them?"
emotional,I think my fiance is abusing me emotionally but I__ not sure,"I__ 22f and he__ 30m and I feel like our 3y relationship was him gaslighting me the whole time. The yelling, fights, outbursts out of nowhere and the changing from sweet and loving to a monster started when we moved in together.  It started with belittleing me in front of his family, gaslighting, slowly attaking my inteligence, my character. Then he started to insult me a lot, call me names, came up with a nickname, and then slowly came the yelling, cursing me out, calling me disabled and stupid, fighting for no reason, everything was always my fault. He never admits to anything, and makes me question my own reality. I Find myself trying to coverup his behaviour because I don__ want people to think badly of him. When I try to express my feelings to him and Tell him what bothers me in our relationship he sometimes doesn__ Say anything, he says that I__ blowing it up, I__ overreacting, I__ a drama Queen and I really like drama. I feel very unheard, I__ down all the time and I__ never happy. I really love him, and I__ finding myself begging for his affection But he only gives to me sometimes or when he wants sex. His friends are very important to him and he spends time with them more than me and this was always a problem in our relationship. He never wants to hang out with my family or friends, Said that he is not interested in having a bond with them because he wants me not them. I have very little social life because he made me turn down every invitation from my friends (also married). He only hangs out and talks with his 3 of his best friends. Now nobody invites me anywhere. I want to get out But I don__ know how, and I really need someone to Tell me I__ not crazy.   Tldr: I think I__ being emotionally abused and in a toxic relationship."

emotional,"Anyone here from Saskatoon, Canada?",I__ from Saskatoon and am looking to escape my situation. I want to make a safety plan relative to my area. Is there anyone here who can help me out?
emotional,It__ SO damn hard to leave,"I__ frustrated that I only have the courage to pack my things up and leave only when my brain fog clears up. Then it can be minutes or days until it returns again, and I forget everything he put me through.   I am sick of the cycle in which he plays nice then when he starts a rage fit like a fully grown toddler, only to deny he did anything.   I want to pack up my things and go home, but I know that if he catches on to my plan he will either try to stop me or promise he__l do better. Why is it so damn hard?????"
emotional,How do I break a trauma bond?,I__ going through a lot of guilt cycles and etc. Is there a way to break a trauma bond?   I find myself having to constantly go back and read through my posts and my journal because I__ forgetting what happened - only thinking of the good times.
emotional,Is this EA?,"I__ going to try to explain everything, because there is a lot.   First, my mom use to say mean hurtful phrases to me, for example __our lazy and stupid._   My aunt and mom-mom use everyone else by Manipulating us to clean up or do everything. My mom-mom also has favorites and no one else can live up to the favorite.   They all also put a lot of pressure on me (I__ a woman) to have children. I can barely talk to them anymore.   My sisters will both push my boundaries and also make fun of me all the time.   I__ just terrified of the holidays now. I can__ have opinions so why should I even talk.   I__ so tired and scared. I don__ know what to do."

physical,He accused me of abusing him,"I__ in a poly marriage. My violent husband and I have drifted apart and we pretty much only live in the same house at this point. I can__ leave because I have no money and I have dogs. I wouldn__ be able to take them with me if I left and they__e my whole life. I have already looked into options for them so please I don__ need advice.    Yesterday my abusive husband went on a Tinder hookup with a stranger. I got mad when he returned and told me that he did, because I__e been confining and he messed it up. I told him to stay away from me.   This morning I bitched about the fact that he went on a date again, and I told him he was stupid. Arguing ensued and he came close to me. I told him to stay away and he refused. Then he licked my lips just to __nfect_ me.    I have been in contact with very, very few people in the last month and a half and he messed it up.    I lost it. We argued some more and he beat me, strangled me several times, sat on my chest, slapped me etc.    Only good thing is that now I know his moves, so I knew how to defend myself a little better. But he still got me since he__ like double my size.    At some point he said __here__ a kind of abuse where the abuser pushes their partner to hit them just so they can have power_ or something like that. So he called ME the abuser there. Which just shows he would do anything to not take responsibility.   He said proof that I was that type of abuser was that those abusers lived a parasitic lifestyle. I am not a parasite. I used to work, but his frequent beatings have made me terrified of working now. I made more money than him in 2018. And at home I do all the cleaning, I care for the animals, and I run the errands. All he does is sleep and work for his mother who overpays him because no one else would hire him.   He finally left.   Has anyone noticed that after having their hair pulled so often, the scalp doesn__ hurt as much?"
physical,My MIL threw a phone at my FIL and hit him in the head,"I__ living with my MIL and FIL, along with my partner. We just moved in after not being able to afford our current place. Tonight my MIL threw a phone at my FIL__ head and hit him pretty hard. They were both very drunk. My partner tried to mediate and the violence escalated. My partner then called the police just because it looked like my MIL was going to harm my FIL again. She then screamed at my partner and insisted he not call the police. The police came and both my FIL and MIL said everything was fine and sent them away. No arrests or charges made. She then taunted me because I was crying and afraid. I screamed at her and told her to stay away from me.   I have a history of past trauma and abuse so this incident has shaken me. I haven__ had to deal with this stuff since growing up in my own abusive household. I__ gonna lose my shit if I have to deal with this type of abuse long term. I don__ feel safe here but I have nowhere else to go. I don__ want to leave my partner either. My partner feels like he has to stay to protect his dad and their two cats from danger, which I understand. I also have no idea how to act around her now. I__ afraid to be here."
physical,Are these situations with my ex bf worth reporting?,"I__ looking for some advice on whether or not I should report some things that happened between me and my ex bf. He currently is on probation for domestic violence for physically assaulting me and giving me a concussion. Now that is all said and done, I still struggle with the things he did to me BEFORE and even AFTER!! his sentencing that I never told anyone about. Is it too late to report things that happened within the last 1.5 years? Do I just let this go and try and move on bc is it even worth it?  ______- Has showed up to my home multiple times when I told him not to while blocked from phone/social media  Has threatened to harm or kill me many times. I do have a voicemail of him saying ____ to the point where I literally just want to fu**ing k__ like, just UGH _- I would just fu**ing love to watch you suffer and die ..._ it__ extremely obvious in this voicemail he was about to say he literally just wants to __ucking kill_ me. So not sure if this is considered proof   Has not used the pull out method during sex sometimes when that was always our agreed to method. Sometimes he would say, ____ so sorry I couldn__ help it, it just happened so fast_  Any time I was not in the mood to have sex with him, he either 1. Begged me until I gave in 2. Kept putting my hand on his crotch 3. Pretend to be sad and make me feel guilty, saying that a __irlfriend should always want their bf_ or 4. Would start a fight with me and say I__ being __hady_ or am a slut and accuse me of cheating... things like __ell then who else have you been sleeping with since you don__ want it from me?_ _ Me saying no was the result of the last time he assaulted me btw  Threatened to send nude photos of me to his friends, my exes or anyone he thought was my potential new boyfriend so they __ould all look and laugh at_ also refused to delete any explicit photos of me when asked (have text message proof)  Has given me an STD... and then lied and said he got tested and that he was negative... but he really never did get tested (have text proof)  Constant name calling and body shaming (text/voicemail proof)  Pushed me out of his car while it was moving and almost ran me over. This is bc we got in a fight for me asking to see his phone. He left me out in the middle of no where to scare me and came back to pick me up a few mins later and I was crying and he made me promise I would stop accusing him of doing bad things before I could get back in the car  Also.... would like to add that I did not request payment/restitution for the assault. I went to the ER a few days after incident (since i still had symptoms of a concussion) and my insurance covered it anyway. It wasn__ until after the case was closed I got bills from an MRI, and MRI test results showing how severe the impact was, also recommended neuropsychologist appts./therapy to recover my memory and thinking.   I know this is a lot and covers so many different subjects but ANY feedback/thoughts/opinions is so so so appreciated."
physical,Videos you recommend?,"I__ looking for videos (YouTube etc) to watch.   I__e left my abuser, but I__ struggling to process emotions. I would like to know if you have recommendations for someone *after* leaving the relationship. In the aftermath so to speak.   Most videos are about the escape, planning the escape or how to tell if you are a victim. I would like some sources for my current situation.   Thank you everyone."
physical,Things got bad lastnight. I need to tell my story and someone to tell me things will be ok.,"I__ not in a good state right now, sorry for the rambling...What happened... Last night around 8:30pm my (28f) bf (32m) came to my apartment door. I spend most days with him but today I went for a walk with my longtime friend (my older brothers old roommate) and his girlfriend. My friends cousin (male) who lives close to the walking path came to join us, then we went for a drink after. I had 2 glasses of wine and went home.  2 hours later my bf arrived. He was very drunk, but in good spirits telling me about his day. When it came to me telling about my day and him finding out that the male cousin was there, he insisted that it was a __ate_ and that my friends were trying to set me up. My friends have never met him, but they know of him. This was nothing of a double date. Nothing I said could convince him that my friends weren__ trying to set me up and that it was just a friends get together.   He started shouting. I told him to stop which made him shout more that he__ not going to stop. I told him I__ not speaking to him anymore if he__ going to act like that. He got up, grabbed my wrist very hard and backed me into the couch. Then grabbed my face and dug his thumb into my cheek. This was very painful. He__ a huge 6_5 guy. He finally let go...knowing from a previous relationship how bad things can get, I calmly started putting my boots on. I did this to be ready to run and/or if I have to kick. He saw me put them on, and grabbed my wrists again. I told him over and over again that it was hurting me and to not touch me. He wouldn__ stop and seemed to be trying to force kiss me getting right in my face. I finally had enough and started to freak out. I had a very clear and clean shot straight to the groin but didn__ want to get that aggressive yet, but I did hit and kick till he let me go.   He was still blocking the exit door though. I tried to run to the bathroom to lock myself in but he got to the door before me. He kept insisting that I sit down and talk with him. I was telling him to leave my apartment and that he NEVER gets to touch me. He was backing me into the corner of the bathroom. I was telling him I__ call someone, his aunt, my brother, my friend. I was scared to get anyone else involved though. I did try to look up his aunt, I did have her on Facebook at one point but now I don__. He somehow knew I didn__ have her so he was egging me to look for her.   I got out of the bathroom with him then turned back and made a run for the door just in time to lock myself in. He was slamming on the door. Going between telling me he__ going to break it down to begging me to come out and talk to back to banging and threatening to break it down. All the while I was crying and telling him to just leave. I only have his mom (who doesn__ speak English) and one of his friends phone numbers in my phone so I called the friend. I put the friend on speaker and said that I__ locked in the bathroom and that he__ drunk and aggressive. I asked the friend to come pick him up. The friend said he can__ help me but wanted to speak with him. They spoke in Serbian over speaker through the door. And bf seemed a lot more calm and promised me to leave. I opened the bathroom door believing he was calmed down but I was wrong. He was incredibly pissed that I called his friend saying I stole his dignity that it__ the only thing he had, that I had no right. He told me when he spoke Serbian to the friend, he told the friend I just went crazy. He said he will make me feel the same way and call my friends and family and tell them I__ fucking strangers in the streets or something to make me look bad.   My phone was in my back pocket. He demanded I give it to him. My phone is my lifeline. I don__ have a laptop and I__ in a different country. I use it for all my payments and I would have no way to contact anyone, book a flight home or pay for anything as I would have to transfer money to my card.  He again lounged at me for my phone, I knew I had to fight him off hard this time. He was on top of me grabbing for my phone so I started punching, kicking and grabbing for his groin to stop him from taking my phone but he got it anyway. He sat down proud of himself with it. I tried to get it a few times but he hurt my wrist when I tried so I knew it was useless. I stood against a high wall by the kitchen that came to the middle of my back. I told him to give me my phone and leave again he got madder than I__ ever seen him. He jumped up screaming in my face pushing me painfully into the high wall making me bend backwards over it and again squeezing my wrist. I told him it was hurting but he wouldn__ stop. I again tried to fight back. I kneed him as hard as I could in the groin. That__ when he grabbed my neck and started choking me. Next thing I knew, I was on the bathroom floor with him still choking me. He got off and start saying things like look how far you make me go all while I cried on the floor.   He helped me up. I decided to just stop fighting back. I went to the couch. He then grabbed a knife. Put the knife in my hands and put the tip up to his chest and told me to stab him. That none of the physical pain he caused me compared to the emotional pain I caused him and I should just stab him in the heart. I told him to stab himself if he wanted to be stabbed. I felt a little more confident with a knife in my hand and told him he made me sick and that I hated him. He said he wanted to jump out the window and I said good. And that he should stab himself in the leg too. He grabbed the knife from me and said I was a bitch for saying that and then faked jabbed/threatened to stab the knife into my leg to scare me. He said he should beat me for saying that to him knowing how much emotional pain he was in. That I deserved a beating. He got on his knees calmly telling me this. The calm scared me the most. I told him let__ go to bed and sleep this off. Trying to be calming a coaxing....he told me to go to bed and that he wouldn__ bother me. I got ready for bed and he went to the bathroom with the knife. I waited a little while then went in to calmly take it away so he doesn__ hurt himself. I took the knife out of his hands and hid it. He locked himself in the bathroom for a while after that but I could hear him smoking so I knew he didn__ hurt himself. I went to bed, he came in some time after.   He is gone and I am safe now."
physical,Was I triggered or was this abuse?,"I__ not longer with this guy (27M) for other reasons, but I (24F) had a long term relationship with a guy who treated me pretty well throughout our relationship of about 4 years. Ultimately we split because we weren__ compatible going forward. Things have since turned pretty nasty between us unfortunately, as we__e both still financially tied together through a house we__e trying to sell.  Something happened in our relationship last year that bothered me quite a bit. We were sitting on a couch and started play wrestling just a little bit (something we never really did) but it was fun. He ended up grabbing me by the throat (did not choke me or anything and was not in a sexual context) which terrified me because I had been grabbed by the throat out of anger by an abusive ex in the past. I freaked out, he started laughing at first until he realized I was genuinely upset, then apologized for it. I went out for awhile to calm down, to which he came out and apologized again, trying to make sure I was okay. I came back inside later and explained that he knew I had a history with that and it doesn__ seem like something someone would ever do even just as playing around.   I__ curious if this was maybe a bad sign back then, like maybe an indicator or something. Or if maybe it was a genuine accident from a dumb guy who__ used to wrestling his brothers. I guess the reason I__ asking is through our breakup he__ been showing a lot of narcissistic behaviors and I__ trying to figure out if maybe I missed red flags in the past or if I__ being out of line now."
physical,Friend doesn__ want to press charges but should the police be informed in case he does this again,"I__ not sure if you__l be able to help me. My friend recently left her abusive partner due to him causing her to end up in a&amp;e due to head injury. She has finally blocked him on everything and hopefully he will leave her alone. I am so happy that she is safer now but this seems to be a pattern of behaviour from him, should the police be informed in case he does this to someone else? Or is there something else that could be done? This is all taking place in the UK"
physical,Considering pressing charges,"I__ not sure where to even start or if it__ even worth reporting. Apart of me wants to report it to help prevent him from hurting others in the future but another part is super unsure if it__ worth the hassle I guess. A general summary of experiences:  - Choked multiple times, I have pictures of bruises around my neck and forearms   - Smashed phone, completely shattering it into 2 pieces  - I went to an urgent care for X-rays of my arm when he sprained my wrist. I lied to the nurses and made up a story of how it happened instead of saying my partner had done it when he was angry so I__ not sure how that would play out.  - There__ security camera footage from his cousins house of him shoving me to the ground out of the door and most likely captured him yelling and me screaming/fighting him off of me during a time that he was choking me. I also have pictures of my busted lip from this day as well.   Other than this, I don__ really have any other solid evidence except text messages, my therapist if that__ a thing, and my own experiences. Any advice would be great!"
emotional,Please read,"I__ not sure where to start or what I__ really trying to get out of this; advice I guess_Here goes nothing   So I__ currently with my high school sweet heart (ig you could say) next month we__l be out 4 year anniversary. We have a one year old son and I am engaged. Ever since we got together he__ had anger issues and I mean bad.

There was an instant where he woke up late for work and tired to say I shut his Alarm off on purpose even though I did not and flipped out on me and said we were done. I took our son to a friends for a few days and he didn__ talk to me at all. And was still insisting that I shut it off. Eventually we did talk and he was being weird about it, like he was the victim. Even though he put himself in that scenario. To simply put it he gets angry over the smallest things and acts like everything has to go his way. Can someone explain why he__ this way? Also anytime it happens he talks suicidal"
emotional,Please read,"I__ not sure where to start or what I__ really trying to get out of this; advice I guess_Here goes nothing   So I__ currently with my high school sweet heart (ig you could say) next month we__l be out 4 year anniversary. We have a one year old son and I am engaged. Ever since we got together he__ had anger issues and I mean bad. He doesn__ hit me and never has, but he flips out over the smallest things, for example, if something of his gets misplaced he__l blame everyone else for it and say someone moved it (even though no one does) and even when he finds it, he doesn__ apologize for accusing people.

physical,Struggling to come to terms with the bad things I did while in an abusive relationship,"I__ not totally sure if this is the right place to post this. I was in a brief sexual relationship when i was 19 with a man who was 31. He had sex with me while i was asleep (raped me) and was generally incredibly emotionally manipulative. I have come to terms with all of this, but i struggle to forgive myself for the harm it has caused my current relationship.  I was dating my current bf while still talking to abuser for about 9 months. In this time, he constantly made digs at my bf, encouraged me to talk shit about him, and was always trying to pressure me to do sexually explicit things with him and even put photos of me on a website for threesomes after i eventually said he could after about three hours of him berating me into it. I know i am a victim in all this. But i feel like i have really treated my current bf like shit because of this.   How does anyone else cope with the bad things they did because of an abuser? I can__ really speak to anyone in my real life about the specifics of it and just really need to unburden myself."
physical,I wanna leave but I__ so afraid,"I__ over $40k in debt because of this asshole and I__ so afraid to leave. He broke my heart and spirit.   I contemplate suicide often and I get drunk to feel numb.   I wish I listened to everyone who told me to leave him.   When he doesn__ get his way he insults me, breaks stuff and threatens to hurt my dogs.   I just want to end it all. How the fuck am I able to love someone who treats me so poorly?"
emotional,How do you truly deal with gaslighting?,I__ really struggling. My husband (separated) gaslights me everyday. I send him perfectly reasonable messages and he will use the _?_ react on iMessages or he will say __hat are you talking about?_ Then when I tell him he is being emotionally abusive he will say __ow_ and dispute everything I say. He will try to make me second guess myself every chance I get. He will turn off his phone when we are arguing or even block me after saying something to make me very angry. I__ just over it. And he treats me with no respect. He doesn__ reply for hours and then vaguely replies. He is a terribly abusive human and I need to go no contact with him but I love him so I__ drawn to the abuse because it__ the only contact I get from another human. And we are married so I trust him and want to talk to him for him to throw it all in my face. I__ struggling. I__ at the end of the rope here. __ please give me tips to get over this because I am very sad. I block him and then I get sad I__ not hearing from him. None of this works.  And I deserve better but I will never get better.
physical,How do I deal with my abuser and his family with coparenting? I__ scared for my baby and myself. They__e also making my life hell.,"I__ sorry for the length I wanted to give as much necessary information as needed. I was engaged and found out I was pregnant a few days after. We__e known each other since 2014. I thought things would get better and he acted better around the time he proposed so I thought he wasn__ like that anymore. He just used to be really hurtful and rude with comments and cheat when we were younger never really physically harmful. During my pregnancy, he COMPLETELY escalated to this whole new level. My son__ father started threatening at first to kick me out because I was crying. I had a broken foot and heavily pregnant. He would just stare at me struggling and walk away while trying to get my cast boot on because of my pregnant belly it made it VERY difficult. I got to where I walked against doctor__ orders without it because he refused to help me unless people were watching him. One day my pregnancy emotions and frustration with the boot I started crying and he told me to get out, leave my ring, and he would send child support. I went to get my purse and he started throwing things around the room. I covered my belly to protect my baby and he became angrier. He then just acted like it never happened and went back to playing video games. It happened again, the next time he said if I tried to leave he would slash my car tires and make me wait for family to come get me. (They live two hours away from him.) he started making cruel comments as jokes saying __e destroyed his dreams._ He called our unborn baby a __astard spawn_ as a joke and I got upset he adamantly denies he said it, but I heard it and he said it to my face clear as day. I texted to my mom and best friend as soon as it happened because I was so upset and I knew if I called he would hear and get violent. He eventually started throwing things in my direction, and almost hit our unborn baby in the head with a gaming controller and threatened to shoot items within arms length of me while sitting next to his loaded handgun. I left to stay with my family during my last trimester it was my obgyn__ orders in case I had complications or went in labor early they didn__ want me so far from them. He told me the day I left if I didn__ bring our child back to his family within a week of birth, then he would take him by force to bring to his family without me. I said I was breastfeeding and his only response was __here__ formula._ I immediately told my family. I reached out to my local domestic violence they told me under no circumstances should he be present or aware of the birth and he shouldn__ be on the birth certificate. I didn__ inform him and eventually his sister texted me until I told her a few days after. She was already aware I told her I felt unsafe around her brother before the birth since the violence has increased. She did nothing. He called her  4 year old daughter a __ittle bitch._ They kicked him out of their home. His family is VERY aware of his behavior, but are blaming me. When it happens to them though they blame him. I__e never had this issue with past partners, ONLY HIM. Things have only got worse since. They keep saying I took the birth and his name from him. I__ upset. He doesn__ provide for our baby, he made me feel so scared and unsafe for our baby and myself that I didn__ include him. I was genuinely afraid he was going to take him as threatened. He said I could recover there and he would help me. He didn__ help me when my foot was broken even though he had been told multiple times by my doctors and me that he needed to. I was afraid of being stranded and not having help too while recovering. My mother saved up her vacation from the time they were told of my pregnancy just to spend it helping me recover and teaching me about child care, as this is my first baby and I have no experience. His family was making parenting choices saying they could overrule me on decisions involving our son__ care if they agreed and I didn__. They actually tried on a few things before birth.  Saying I couldn__ have our son sleep in our room in a crib or pack n play. That he needed to sleep down the hall without a baby monitor they felt that was better than my preference. I__e tried giving him opportunities to co parent and be civil, he just does more harm than good with our baby. I had our baby sleeping in his own crib in the same room from his first day home. He spent time with him and tried to force sleep training at 2 months old. Our son now clings to me in my bed through the night and cries immediately if set in the crib for any reason. He would also yell at me in front of our baby and call me names, and now if anyone starts raising their voice whether happy or mad my son gets HIGHLY upset. Both my baby and I are both VERY on edge and upset anytime we stay for periods with his family for them to bond. My therapist appointed by the domestic violence office said she was SEVERELY concerned for my mental well being and my son__ every time we stayed there we seemed so different and bothered. I was considering suicide but didn__ for my son. He started physically harming me, and the verbal as well as emotional abuse significantly increased during our visits. I would then take our son and leave to go be at my parent__ home. His family is angry that I left with our baby and don__ stay with him. They said I need to give him more respect to get respect. I tried everything I could to make it work. I heard him VERY agitated with our baby and got worried and went to ask if he was okay and needed to talk. I asked if I needed to take our baby and give him a few minutes. He called me a __ucking idiot._ In response. His mom witnessed it and just said to leave her out of it. He stands by calling me that and said __ell you were being one._ He also stood by throwing things at me saying __t wasn__ that hard._ Or __t__ not like I really beat you._ He pushed my head while I had our son in my arms and said __t wasn__ that hard, that__ not abuse._ He doesn__ support our baby, every time he is involved with his care something negative happens to our baby. He gave him MAJOR doses of cereal in his bottles he felt he was eating too much formula and his doctor said he can no longer have cereal at all. Forcing the sleep training to the point our son refuses to sleep alone now, our son gets VERY upset if anyone raises a voice after he did it a lot around him, saying comments like __f he smothers on a flat surface he deserves to die, natural selection._ Then he would laugh. That comment has been made twice now. I told him in one instance I needed to go to the bathroom in the next room and I would be back to please watch Him. He didn__ have headphones on at the time and was listening and looking directly at me. I then walked in on our son flipped over and smothering two foot from him and he didn__ even notice because he was playing video games. I screamed and ran and grabbed him. His father just lifted his headphones calmly and said __ell they__e soundproof._ Then went back to his game. I took our son in the other room hysterical checking him over to ensure he was okay and didn__ need medical attention. I called my mother crying after that incident saying we couldn__ do this anymore. Our son just cries so much more in their home as well. He is like a completely different baby around him than when he__ not present. Everyone who has been involved in raising him so far and knows him well says it__ like I didn__ bring the same child home and they__e super concerned. His family has been saying how awful I am for not staying, saying how he deserves his last name and I should have never taken the birth moment from him, saying I need to give him respect constantly. I have honest to God tried to be good to this man and he is constantly insulting me. I hold it in until I contemplate suicide and realize I can__ be around this behavior and neither can my son. He proudly looked at me one day and said __ou know I play mind games just to get you to stay._ And I told his family and they said it must be my fault and I broke down just crying. I about gave up and just took our child back and said I__l eventually kill myself but they__l have what they want. My family stopped me and being away from them I__e not had those thoughts at all since. His family is just giving me a hard time making me out to be so awful for what I did. I don__ like being a bad person and I__e tried so hard to give him opportunities to be a father but it__ harming my child and me more than helping him. He doesn__ even care for him during his visits. I spend the entire time providing supplies and care. He spends maybe ar most 15 minutes of his day with him and that__ it. I suggested he spend more time and try to bond with our baby and he got angry. His family was angry I suggest that. I gave up and stopped contact. I__ sure court is in our future. I__ scared to death for my child. How do I deal with him and his family? I removed them from all social media as they would report everything I post to him. They__e been making my life hell."
physical,Unintentional manipulation?,"I__ sorry if this doesn__ make sense, I__ not really sure how to describe it. Is it possible for someone to unintentionally manipulate and gaslight you? This person has been physically, sexually and verbally abusive in the past but truly doesn__ understand why his behavior is wrong. He has turned over a new leaf and is making good progress but my feelings haven__ changed.  He recently learned what love bombing and coercion is even though he__ been doing it for some time. His abusive episodes have either left me numb, depressed or angry but he literally doesn__ understand why. I go into self preservation mode and emotionally disconnect. He would constantly argue that I need to think about it different and should be happy because he is happy or whatever he wants me to do will make him happy. Even though the behavior has stopped, we have the same arguments and it__ a bit triggering. I__ just left feeling like I__ crazy and constantly unsure about myself. There__ a lot I have had to teach him about autonomy and basic human decency so I feel like he isn__ doing it on purpose but I__ also at my wits end. I just want to feel like I__ not crazy."
physical,Job application questions,"I__ starting my job applications again after relocating from home. A couple questions:  - What do I put as my residential address? I__e been moving around from place to place.  - Is it easy to open up a bank account without my dad noticing? How can I do this? (Afaik, my account is connected to his) Should I apply to jobs first, or open up a bank account? - In what ways might I anticipate having to tell the interviewer about my situation? (Such as ____ a survivor of domestic violence, and had to make some hard choices to get out of that situation_)"
emotional,why am I the one being punished for reacting like a human being?,"I__ tired of being the bad guy when I __eact_ to him. I__ the one apparently who makes it __orse_ when I break down crying, panic, dissociate, isolate, or react in a *human* way.  Because I have emotions, and I__ tired of having to be responsible for how __onvenient_ it is for other people. I__ like to say *I don__ care*, but I do__ care *so* much. I always feel like a burden because I__ __oo sensitive_ and it becomes a conflict when *I* respond to how he acts. All this notion of conflict mitigation does is enable my dad while stripping me of any self-confidence I ever had.   She keeps saying, __t takes two to tango,_ but apparently tangoing for me is having a normal emotional reaction or not taking his shit and standing up for myself, which I can__ even do anymore.  All I need is for her to say it__ not my fault. Just a smidge of validation. Because each time, I begin to feel worse about myself. And then after a few days, I begin to assume that I am *actually* the one creating the problem because most of the time he__ nice when I do everything I can not to provoke him. Then he does it again, and the cycle restarts.  Like what do I even do if I get diagnosed with the personality disorder they think I have? It means he permanently fucked me up. That *I* was so vulnerable that even as my sister was beat as a child while I wasn__, *I__* the one who got messed up from having to watch. That his sporadic actions as I began my teenage years, dismissed by professionals as __addy issues,_ traumatized me?  How will I live with that knowledge as I__ in this house, still dependent on my parents? I__l have to avoid even more. It already feels like it__ all I do. I just don__ want to be afraid anymore."
physical,Tired,I__ tired of my family. I want to run away. I want to die. I wish I was never born.
physical,My BF beat me 3 times in 6 months but I love him so much idk what to do,"I__e always been super cautious about who I let into my life- especially my love life. I was single for 4 years but this October I thought I met __he one_.. we fell in love basically the first night- I__e never experienced anything like this... he was so amazing (like they always are at the beginning) wanting to give me an amazing life and sooo incredibly kind and sweet to me. He told me that he would NEVER lay a finger on me and that he would never hurt me or break my heart. But he told me that he has a problem with alcohol (of course) and turns into a horrible person when he__ drinking. The first time he Was drunk and I pissed him off by getting mad at him when he was disrespectful to me. He dragged me down my hallway into my garage, threw me into my car, and slapped me once on the face super hard. The next day he tried to deny it and then when he accepted it he acted so remorseful and so sorry promising to never do it again. (This story sounds like every other abuse story:(((  &lt;|3 anyways last night he was drunk AF like couldn__ even walk drunk... out of nowhere he just starts throwing me around, choking me, hitting me with a pillow as hard as he could at least 30 times, punched my back and slapped me. I woke up by him in a panic attack thinking about the night before. I was so mad I started yelling at him at 6:30am, I shoved him bc I couldn__ believe him and I grabbed his face bc I wanted to punch him sooo much but I can__ bring myself to hit someone. I__e never been violent or even been in a fight. He got so mad that he threw me into the wall 6-7x made a huge hole in my wall, slapped me as hard as he could across my face at least 20x I have 2 black eyes now. it__ been the worst one by far. He says he only gets like that bc I know how to provoke him and that he really loves me and that I make him crazy. Now this afternoon he just went and got my initials tattood on him and a heart, then started talking about marriage. I__ so hurt all I__e wanted is a happy life with an amazing husband and now I__ just scared and confused. Idk what to do I__ crying typing this while he__ asleep next to me. I__e been laying by him awake for 3 hours now I can__ even fall asleep by the person I would call my twin and the love of my life... never experienced pain like this before please help"
emotional,My parents keep me up at night,"I__e been emotionally abused by them. A lot. I don__ know if I deserved it though. Sometimes I feel like I might__e. Even though I KNOW I didn__. They__e kind of insane. Once I tried asserting dominance in an argument and suggested that I was allowed to have my own feelings and opinions, and my mom asked me, where did that idea come from? In all honesty, she asked me what gave me the idea that I, a human being, was allowed to have a BIG say in my current life and future. My dad once told me that I had no good qualities. Once they lectured me for two hours in the garage, on a school night, about why they hated me having a boyfriend and why my ideas of going to college after I graduated were stupid and unreasonable. It sickened me that my mom offered that I stay home from school the next day since they basically kept me from sleeping by, y__now, screaming at me and making me question any original thought I ever had. But hey, here I am, still living with them, and like, it__ just so weird. Most days feel like, okay and whatever. I financially depend on them (and have no intention of declaring independence) so I have sort of decided to just, go with the flow here and tough it out until we can figure out college. And generally, I__ okay, they haven__ yelled in a while, or called me stupid, but then again I haven__ prompted it too much either. I don__ know, maybe I am stupid for not trying to get away as fast as I can. I__ like to think that I__ trying my best given the situation. The nights just sometimes get hard when I remember the screaming they__e done. And all of my friends have expressed their concerns. I__ not in danger, I just have to keep a level head and remember, no matter how nice they can appear, they still have the capacity to rip me to shreds mentally and not bat an eye about doing so. I definitely could go on forever about this, but I guess I just wanted to sort of share a bit of my story with anyone on this sub. The takeaway being, that even if you can__ get away from your abusers yet, you__e not weak. You__e only weak if you deny to admit that the abuse ever happened. Recognizing it is the first step, don__ forget it."
physical,"I suppose I don__ know if I belong here or not, other people seem to think so","I__e been in a relationship for almost 4 years with someone I__e known for years.  I__e known he has anger issues but I thought they were improving.  I get shouted at for things I don__ even know that I__e done.  Apparently I constantly forget things he__ told me or asked me to do.  Any time something happens, it__ my fault for my poor communication skills.  He doesn__ work, but I have to work full time (even though he belittles the long hours I work as a nurse because I only work a maximum of 40 hours a week).  When I don__ make enough money, it__ my fault.  He wants to know my every move.  If I leave the room without saying something and he starts to talk to me, then it__ my fault.   He__ never been violent towards me.  But I__ scared to tell him things because I know he__l be angry.  But when I get upset then he says I__ making excuses and arguing.    As of this afternoon, he__ left me because when he asked me about the money situation I told him I had _£260 instead of _£260.16.  I have no vehicle in my name. No money to get to work next week and I don__ know what to do."
physical,I became the abuser last night,"I__e been in a volatile and abusive relationship for years. Psychical violence, control, and spousal rape. Oh and of course gas lighting like none of this has never happened to me. It__ been a while since things got physical. About over a year honestly. The spousal rape happens more often.   We broke up for a summer and when we got back together and he found out I had slept with other people he pretty much chummed it up to me cheating and being dishonest the whole time. So to him I am a liar through out the relationship. He no longer has anger issues because you know justified behavior for being a __hore_.   Last night he was drunk like drinking for about 8 hours straight drunk. He got in my face and started telling me that all I did during our relationship was choke on dick. He told me on one would take me in because no one loves me. I snapped. He was in my face and saying things like I deserved to be screamed at all night. At this point I was kicking and pushing for him to get away from me and verbally screaming this. He got directly in my face and I close fist punched him in the face.   I__e never done anything like this and I feel disgusted in myself. I know what I did was wrong. I came back to his place today and cleaned up the drunken mess for an hour. Cleaned up all his blood etc. (I don__ know if I actually made him bleed because it seems after he left he punched a bunch of walls).   Leave before you do what I did. Leave before you lose yourself. Don__ stay until you have lost yourself completely."
emotional,__ou__e so hypersensitive to this stuff___usband__ response to my offense at his jokes,"I__e been married for more than years and we have 3 little children (6yo, 4yo, 3yo) plus his teenaged (15yo) son from his first marriage. I__ 28(F) and he__ 42 (yes, I__ 14 years younger than him).   My SS (stepson) is here for holiday break. I was in the room nearby and overheard my husband and him dialing my FIL (father-in-law) on FaceTime. He answered and immediately my husband said, __ho__ this big ugly guy?_, then he backtracked and started asking my FIL if he liked my SS__ new haircut (he recently had a perm but went back to his normal texture and trimmed it). Overhearing the __ig ugly guy_ joke made me feel uneasy but I didn__ get involved. I wanted to understand what was going on and give husband the benefit of the doubt. I (perhaps foolishly) started googling stuff about jokingly saying someone is ugly. Every advice flagged the behavior as verbally/emotionally abusive. I felt sick to my stomach. I also overheard them bickering about playing football earlier and my SS laughing and explaining why he missed a catch because his eyes were closed. Husband said jokingly __hat kind of a wide receiver closes his eyes? (SS plays wide receiver in his hometown in KY where he lives most of the time). I felt increasingly uneasy, especially after the stuff I was finding on google. I got up and went into the shower to process and figure out what to do. Husband came in to see if I was okay. I immediately said I heard his joke about SS being __gly_. He said it was just a joke. I said I didn__ want to hear excuses about joking that a kid is ugly. He left. As I was getting in bed about 20 mins later husband came back and said he went back to SS and apologized and said he doesn__ really think he__ ugly, it was wrong choice of words that just slipped out when SS was making faces at the FaceTime camera, and he asked SS how his joke made him feel. He tried to explain to me the SS was making __tupid_ faces up close to the camera when FIL answered so that was my husband__ __lip of the tongue_ that he says he quickly realized was wrong and started backtracking trying to say how good his haircut looked, etc. And he tried to explain the football comment saying that SS told him he tried to throw the football at him earlier when he wasn__ looking as __ay back_ for when my husband threw the ball and SS missed it because his eyes were closed (hence my husband saying __hat kind of wide receiver closes his eyes?_).   Anyways_ his initial response when I tried to get to the bottom of the jokes that I felt uncomfortable with was that I was __o hyper sensitive about this stuff_. Admittedly, I was not happy and that was obvious__nd it__ also not the first time I__e criticized his parenting; but neither was I yelling at him or otherwise having some kind of melt down. I was genuinely upset and in my mind thought I was sticking up for a kid who he might have just hurt (even if unintentionally). We didn__ go to bed on a good note but this morning he came to me and said sorry for calling me hypersensitive and that he__ not excusing his poor choice of jokes but feels that I was __o angry_ at him that makes him defensive because he feels like I__ always attacking him when he does something that I think is wrong. I felt like accepting his apology because I felt it was genuine, but then when I tried to explain my feelings he tried to reiterate in different words that I__ overreacting/ungracious and said that I don__ even hear myself talking when those conflicts are happening. I felt upset by that because I feel like I__ not allowed to show my upset when I think (mistakenly or not) that he__ hurting a child__ feelings.   I went to a coffee shop and there he texted me that he__ not making excuses but thinks that I harbor so much resentment towards him that it comes out as anger towards him when he makes a mistake, and he said he doesn__ act that way when I make mistakes and wants more grace from me like he extends to me.   I feel really confused and I admittedly am super sensitive but really don__ think his jokes were okay, no matter how he slices it (accident, context that__ I missed because I wasn__ in the room, etc).   What are your thoughts?"
emotional,It__ been a while,"I__e been out of a bad situation for a while, but I still think about it a lot. I had some friends that I think were emotionally abusive to me but I get worried that I__ just blowing what they did out of proportion in my mind or if I was really the one who was being antagonistic. Around the same time I was friends with them I messed up some other ones because I just can__ get ahold of social awareness.  The more o think about it the more I find that almost everyone in that friend group was toxic. Even the person that kept telling me that I was a good person that just needed the right people who could take the time to know me ended up being kinda two faced with what they did behind my back. I__ worried that I__ just in that situation where you keep surrounding yourself with terrible people because you__e a terrible person. I__e kinda locked myself away since then, I can__ tell if I__ just garbage or I just need to meet the right people.   Only two or three people have been outright emotionally abusive, but it just made all of this harder to handle. Hell, I only stayed friends with them because at least they pretended to like me."
physical,Does anyone else have similar feelings?,"I__e been out of my abusive marriage for a little over a year now. I__e finally let all of my feelings go for this individual and have started to stop blaming myself for the things that happened. My nightmares are becoming less and my anxiety isn__ as bad when I don__ have to deal with anything directly relating to him.   I__e been seeing someone new for a few months now. Recently I have begun telling him stories of things that have happened. And as I am recalling them, I__ realizing more and more that things that seemed trivial to me before, are actually HUGE red flags.   Does anyone else have the same kind of experience? Things you thought weren__ __hat bad_ at the time, were actually more severe than you realized ?"
physical,"Thinking about a DV shelter, not sure what to expect","I__e been thinking for a little bit about trying to go to a shelter, but I__ really nervous and I__ very unsure of how it works and what they__e like.   I (22F) live with my partner (28M) who is very violent and sexually abusive to me. We were together for almost three years in the past, then we broke up for a bit and then recently I__e moved back in with him and we__e together again. I feel dumb for it now, but I really thought he__ be better this time.  The last couple of nights have been really bad, and it__ made me think about going to a shelter. I have a lot of questions about them and I thought maybe someone here would be able to answer them. I don__ have children and I__ from the UK if that changes any answers.  Is it at all likely that there__l be any spaces? I__e heard with covid that they__e struggling for space and I feel silly maybe taking a space from someone who might need it more.  What am I supposed to bring? Are you allowed to bring phones?   Am I allowed to go to one given I went back to my boyfriend? I knew what he__ like, but I still went back. Is that ok?  What is it like in a shelter, what does a day look like? Do you feel like it helped?   Do I need to be able to prove abuse? I__e never called the police on this boyfriend and I definitely wouldn__ want to. I don__ think there__ anyone who would confirm that they__e seen him act like that with me and I don__ have anything like recordings or photos to show for it.  I__ sorry that__ a lot of questions. I__ really appreciate any answers so much."
emotional,"I__ thinking of reporting my EA, not for what he did to me, but something else",I__e been with him for almost a year now. Months ago I thought he was emotionally abusing me so I left. Five weeks later I came back to him because I still missed him and cared about him. He changed some of his way temporarily and when he started being abusive to me again I started abusing him back. This made me feel that our relationship was mutually abusive and that my thoughts I had in the beginning were wrong. It felt better not to think of myself as a victim but a abuser as well. I started to research mutual abusive relationships out of curiosity and the more I read the more I realized I was just reacting to his abuse because I was so fed up. All the times I reacted to him he uses against me.  I__ still in love with him. I__ still seeing him about once a week. I__ contacting therapists to try to set up an appointment. Anyways what I really wanted to mention was that one night when he was drunk he joked about having some incest child porn on his computer. I told him that was messed up and he says he deleted it. I don__ think he__ a pedo but I__ considering reporting him as revenge for what he did to me. Can I do that anonymously? is this a bad idea?
emotional,Is this emotional abuse? Or am I a narcissist?,"I__e been with my fianc_© for almost 4 years now. Most days things are good, even great. He can be so kind to me, and caring. Some days are draining. Yesterday we were In the car and I was singing along with my music as I drove. We had dinner at a restaurant and he watched the soccer game on his phone and largely ignored me, so I was quiet until he noticed. We stayed in the restaurant about 20 minutes after we were done eating so he could continue to watch the game.   In the car, as I__ rocking out, he asks if he can call his dad. For context, he hates my singing and my taste in music. I said __o, I__ rather not sit in silence in the car as I drive_. I can__ participate in the conversation because they speak Spanish and I don__. He gets upset and says he doesn__ like my tone and my attitude. I told him, __ou asked, and I gave you my answer, did you just want me to say yes? Are you upset about my attitude, or the answer?_ He starts going on about how I__ so mean to him, he just paid for dinner, I should let him call his dad, and I must hate him because I treat him so poorly. I typically just let him get it out, because if I say anything to defend myself he__l bring up something from a week ago or how he would__e let me make a phone call. We were 20 minutes from home so I said, ____ sorry, but can you wait until we get home?_ And he continued to criticize me, telling me I__ such a mean person, and I__ so selfish. I start thinking, would it be so bad if I just let him call his dad? Im still not listening to my music, because now he__ talking. Then I wouldn__ have to listen to this. He will drill into me and back me in a corner and when I say __ don__ want to talk about this anymore_ he won__ stop until he gets a reaction out of me. And I can__ walk away, he sees it as disrespectful, even when I__e expressed that I do not want to talk, because I__ typically wrong and the person that needs to apologize. In the car, it__ even worse, because we cannot exit the car until it__ resolved.   I apologize for not formulating the words in a way he__ like. Instead of what I said, I should__e said __orry baby I__ really enjoying my music, can you call your dad when you get home?_ And I apologized for being rude. I chose to be done with it and enjoy my music. When we got home I got out the car. He followed me in and acted passive toward me. He didn__ hold the door, or speak to me for the rest of the night, or the next morning unless I spoke 1st. He didn__ come to bed until 1am. And when I woke up and gave him a kiss he pushed me off and wiped his face where I kissed him and seemed disgusted. I__e decided I__ not rewarding his passive behavior and silent treatment with begging for forgiveness. Im just going to act normal and let him look crazy. Or is that a narcissistic response??"
emotional,I told him I basically loved him and he told me to go to bed,"I__e been with this guy for about 2 years. He__ incredible self centred. He__ always gotten his way and it shows in our relationship constantly.  I had an abusive and confusing childhood that I still haven__ figured out or gotten over so at times I will get upset when I have to see my mother. I was coming across as aggressive because I was angry and upset about my Mum but he got mad at me and told me to leave and cool off. He then told me he__ heard all of this before from me and he__ over it.  He also says this when I bring up my mental illnesses, adhd, cptsd and bpd. This happens constantly.   I don__ have a job as I need to be available all the time for him. To take him to work, to do his washing.  I thought I could handle it all, I was going to be the stay at home gf (which now sounds crazy to me, we don__ have kids, why do I need to stay home to care for my 27yr boyfriend) but it__ gotten too much, he only wants to hang out with me when he needs me to do something with me or if I basically scream at him that he__ not spending any time with me.  So last night we were supposed to watch a movie, we had it planned from that afternoon. But he decided to jump on pc to talk to his friend so around 11pm when I was getting ready to sleep I just said, __e were supposed to watch that movie tonight_ and he goes oh shit, then gets off the pc (grumpily I must add) then it was around 12:30 and I said I__ going to sleep and he got mad and said oh now you__e tired. He then proceeded to be mad at me for ruining his night and then not even watch anything with him like I wanted (even though it was 1:30pm at this point)  I then brought up the movie that I thought we had made plans to watch and he replied saying no, we just decided we weren__ watching it anymore. But we hadn__ decided. He had.  I wasn__ upset about the movie, I was upset about the fact that he ditched me again and canceled plans we both had. He never does anything with me so I was really upset when the plans were cancelled so I proceeded to say I can__ do this anymore, I can__ keep feeling unwanted, even hated by him. I told him how much I cared for him and what I would dofor him, what I do do for him. And he told me he__ not talking about this now so I said ok but can you please tell me tomorrow if you want me here.  It__ now 10:30pm the next day and he__ said not a word.  I don__ know what to do. Sorry that was long, there__ so much more but I can__ make sense right now:("
physical,I__e been a survivor but again I__ a victim,"I__e finally come to terms  I learned about 6 months back my husband is a narcissistic abuser. For almost two years he has emotionally manipulated me, cheated on me, by technical standards sexually assaulted me and as of recently physically abused me. I am finally coming to terms that I am stuck.   I met him after leaving an abusive man, and thought he was different...I learned after 6 months he was with MULTIPLE other women. I kept believing him that he__ stop. He never did. I would leave and by the next day I__ be back home. He finally hurt me for the first time March 2020, he locked me in our room and tortured me. Throwing his phone at me, spraying water in and up my nose, making me sleep on the floor, threatening to slit his wrists in front of me. I went to the police the next day and they told me it was useless because I didn__ call during. (He had my phone and I had bruises)  I came back three days later after he sobbed and begged me to help him with his daughter, that she needed me. And then we moved 600 miles away. We got married in June. He cheated all the way until we had a ceremony in September. When he got caught, he beat the hell out of me. I hit back, after he choked me to almost blacking out. (He dislocated my shoulder, and I had multiple marks on my face and neck)   Since then he__ sold my car, had me sign for his car, and regularly emotionally and verbally abuses me.   I am stuck. I am lost. I made a mistake."
physical,Trigger- Suicide and abuse,"I__l try keep this as short as I can.   My mum is severely depressed- has been for years. She__ been on loads of antidepressants that don__ seem to work for her. About 2 years ago she split up with her boyfriend and attempted suicide by overdose. I believe this was a cry for help and she wanted medical professionals to see how desperate she was. They just sent her home that day. Fast forward to today, my mum has been on again off again with this ex boyfriend. He__ no good for her, he__ a coke addict, buys illegal Valium and not to mention extremely abusive (only physical once that I know of). Anyways I__ getting off track, today I get a call she__ been taken into hospital on another suicide attempt and again they send her home with a leaflet filled with telephone numbers to help her. I__ beyond frustrated and upset at the lack of help she__ getting. Also I called the police on the ex who was in the house when I got in (smashed mirror/tv, blood all over my mums clothes and a clump of hair that had been pulled out my mums head). The police were no help either they just removed him from the premises and said to me __e__e all had a boyfriend no one else likes_. I__ really struggling myself and want her to get help. She was so close to getting kept in hospital today which I felt she would have needed and wanted but alas.  Extra details- I live in the UK so NHS services for mental health aren__ the best"
physical,What do you do when you__e the victim on trial... literally?,"I__l try to be concise. Before giving any details I will make it clear that I have a trial on Tuesday for a domestic violence offense that I am being charged with despite being the victim of abuse both physically and mentally and during the incident in question. My ex is emotionally unstable and it__ my personal belief that he has undiagnosed narcissistic personality disorder. He is a 54 year old high school teacher that on the surface appears to be a productive member of the community and has worked at the same school for 20 years. I am a 29 year old male that was between jobs at the time due to a pattern of abuse that slowly took everything away from me that made independent until I became financially dependent upon him without even realizing it was happening. I was kept separate from his social life. He works at a bar on weekends to fund his cocaine addiction and I was not allowed to go there because he pretended to be single and available to __ake more tips from flirting._ I was included in family things but never truly welcomed due to how many fights we had during which they were his support and my support was nothing but myself. He would call the police any time he felt like I should leave during these escalating disagreements despite being over an hour from anyone that I know while living with him towards the end. It reached a point where they began to fine him every time there was a call that didn__ result in arrest. Two weeks before the final incident he had cut the cord off his router so I couldn__ use the internet, broke my laptop and cell phone so I couldn__ contact anyone, left me at his house without telling me where he was going, then cut off the power and let me sit in a house with no power and no way to call anyone or entertain myself for 3 days before returning with a police officer claiming that I was refusing to leave when in reality he trapped me there like I was in jail and I was too embarrassed to ask a neighbor for help. He ended up telling the officer that he changed his mind and we tried to work it out. What I didn__ know is that he meant he was going to tell me that I could stay if I let him fuck me right then and there. With nowhere to go, I felt I had no choice. So he did while verbally assaulting and essentially raping me while I cried into a pillow. He finally said he was too disgusted by me to finish and then called my mother anyway to tell her she needed to get me or I__ be stranded on the street without a car or anyone to help. When my mom came with her neighbor, we all sat down and talked about it. I asked him if he realized what just happened was rape. He scoffed at how outrageous it was to even suggest and said to my own mother __ didn__ even cum._ We all decided it was best to go and so I stayed with my parents for two weeks.  Fast forward 2 weeks later. Against my better judgement I went back. We were at a bar and I wanted to leave but he wanted to continue doing shots. I was not hammered but not sober. I asked if he would take me home and just go back himself and he refused to. He said I could take his car and he__ get a ride home, but at the time I had a suspended license and he knew I couldn__ and wouldn__ risk that again. He continued drinking and doing shots while I nursed a beer for nearly two hours in complete silence waiting for him to stop chatting with a local friend so we could leave. At some point the friend asked us how we were doing as a couple. That__ where it began. He had a habit of latching on to the most innocuous behavior as a reason to be suspicious and then would impose his own reality to explain why I__ either lying about something or cheating and then would insist that his version was the truth no matter how reasonable my explanation was. I mean would insist that things were happening even if it was in direct conflict with reality. He once insisted I was having sex with someone while I ran to the store for 15 minutes and returned with enough bags that a 15 minute shopping trip was actually making surprisingly quick time just because I drove around the block to finish a song I was listening to and he noticed I came from the opposite end of the street than I normally would if I hadn__ gone around the block. Well, when she asked how we were, that__ when the switch flipped. He began accusing me of talking to guys while I was silent and playing on my phone to kill time while I waited for us to go home. I was tired and not having it. I tried to ignore his insistence that I was doing anything other than falling down a Wikipedia rabbit hole, but as usual that escalated into another rehash of everything I__e ever done wrong to him, which like I said is almost entirely random things that never happened but he would insist I did with no logical reason for why he came to these insane conclusions, and it was the same exact fight that we would have each time that just builds upon the last but never resolved anything. Each fight would just be him adding something new to his lists of accusations and there was no way to defend myself because he refused to accept my explanations for things that normal people wouldn__ even think twice about. It was exhausting and it was like being in a constant state of defeat and fear of doing the wrong thing because everything I did had potential to be interpreted as suspicious behavior. Everything I did was given an ulterior motive that I didn__ have and he would say that if I__ just be honest about it, he wouldn__ care. If I just admitted to doing all of these random things I wasn__ doing, then he would understand because he said he could deal with a lot but he couldn__ deal with dishonesty. How the hell can a person be honest in the eyes of someone that refuses to accept the reality of any given situation regardless of the circumstances or the truth? It__ losing by default. It didn__ matter what it was, I was lying about it or omitting some  kind of information. Sometimes I would accept his version of things just to make him stop. I would apologize for things I hadn__ done just to get him to relent. I was always saying sorry. Always wrong. Never enough. He would always say he wants more. If I could just give him more and do more to love him then we wouldn__ have all of the problems we had. If I just hadn__ done that thing I never did then we wouldn__ have gotten to this moment. He truly believed this shit.   Now this is where it gets pretty straightforward. He began to drink more so I tried to go to sleep to avoid fighting while he was drunk and he woke me up at 2 am to continue insisting I had been talking to someone while we were at the bar. I tried to lock the door and he stuck his foot in the frame so I couldn__ shut it. I tried to push past and he just backed up and blocked the stairs. I tried to squeeze around his side and he sort of grabbed me and we struggled a bit and both went down. I don__ know exactly what happened because it was fast and I had just been aggressively woken up to someone screaming at me, but we slid about halfway down the stairs, I__ being pushed and pulled trying to break away from him, and then he sort of popped back up almost using each other for balance and struggled the rest of the way down the stairs on our feet, yet I__ still trying to push away upward while he pulled me down with him. We didn__ end up on the floor but we sort of slammed into the wall at the bottom of the stairs that ended at a perimeter wall and we had been going down in a diagonal direction towards the left side, knocking a dog statue that was set on the windowsill of the window that was set at the bottom landing of the stairs case on the left side we were going down and knocked against. The right side of the staircase was partially open and adjacent to his living room. Going down the left side knocking the decoration out of the window, we must have went around shoes that I had lined up on the right side of the staircase on the first 3 or 4 steps going up. They didn__ get knocked over. At this point I was just trying to get away from him while he tossed some things at me. A table one of us ran into collapsed because the leg had broken off previously from a legitimate accident and I had glued it back on as a temporary fix, which made it instantly snap back off when it was bumped. The last thing that happened was me being backed up against the window in his kitchen while he help up a frying pan as if about to hit me, he grabbed my shirt and I couldn__ see anything so I tried to push him away blindly and terrified, and then he let go and what seemed like an act of pure focused rage, hit his microwave as hard as he possibly could with the pan. It shattered the glass door. He finally backed off and told me to leave. Began to threaten me with the phone again. He would make the gesture like he was going to call if I didn__ leave. This is 3 am in a town where I don__ have a single friend that isn__ an hour away in the city where MY life was. The life I was neglecting for him. No car. No money. Nowhere to go. Nobody to help me. I was hysterical and begging him not to put me out because I didn__ know where I was going to go or what I could have done to get out of the situation I was in. He made the call. I was almost relieved. I didn__ want to deal with cops yet again but at least I felt I would be safe and met with rational people they would actually listen and hear me. I couldn__ have been more wrong about that. I lived there so he needed to have a reason for them to force me to leave. What he did was tell them a modified version of what happened which essentially flipped our roles so that in his story I was the aggressor and the one that woke him up and attacked him and broke his microwave and he had to call the cops because he was afraid I was going to kill him. AFRAID FOR HIS LIFE he told them. It even began with a blatant lie. He said I had already been at the bar for hours and he came there because they had cut me off and called him to say he needed to come get me. I had never gone to this bar alone before, and there was certainly never a time I was cut off for drinking too much. I didn__ even drink beyond a buzz when we had been there hours before. He said he left me there and I somehow found a way home and said I did this regularly because __ always find a way._ That__ what his response was when they asked how I got back if he had left me there. He told them the beers he had cracked and drank strewn all around the house were mine. That I continued drinking when we got home. This is a small town where everyone knows everyone and nobody knows me. They seemed to be implying that they thought I was just a younger guy taking advantage of someone older for a sense of stability and a place to live. Like I was just living the life of luxury on a free meal ticket. It was so insulting. My stability had been taken away from me a long time before that. They never truly asked me what happened or if I was okay because they treated me like I was in an interrogation. They kept interrupting me to question what I told them. It was so obvious that it didn__ matter what I was telling them. They had decided I was making it up. Other cops were talking to him outside and the tone was like he was entertaining friends while I__ inside being interrogated as a victim. I tried to tell one of the officers about all of the previous incidents and his response was to ask me why I would come back if it was so bad. If all of these things were true then it wouldn__ make any sense for me to still be there. He had been to the house on previous calls and he said that I should have known better and there must be some reason I__ withholding that would make it make sense for me to put myself in the situation I had been in over and over. And the fucked up part is that I knew he was right in a way but not right to blame me. I truly convinced myself every time that it was the time things would change. It never changed but I never stopped hoping. That was all that I had and my ex was so good at starving me of positive attention that it almost felt like a gift when he would give me it and treat me like a normal person should treat their partner and I began to crave his attention so much that negative attention was almost better than none at all. At least he was giving me something instead of going off to the bar to be with friends that didn__ know I existed in a social life that I never was a part of. It was like he lived multiple lives that he had to keep separate and would sometimes complain that he was being pulled in every direction while failing to realize that he is the one that made his life to be that way.  I think I was and am the only person that knows his life is like that. The bar life and the school life and the family life, each one a different person and different mask to put on. It__ disturbing in retrospect. And then there was his secret life. That was the one with me. He kept me hidden and excluded from everything he did. Vacations. Events. Things his friends invited him to. Everything but his family. The problem with that is his family didn__ know me. They knew a version of me that was filtered through his lies about what happened behind closed doors. He would lie so much that he would do it out of habit and lie about things that were never going to be a problem or made sense to lie about. He__ say he was with his sister when he was really doing something else and then drunkenly reveal to me that he wasn__ really with his sister but stopped at the bar for a drink. Was actually with his friend Josh because they wanted to catch up. Anything. Why would someone need to lie constantly about what they__e doing? I__ not controlling and I never told him he couldn__ do whatever he wanted to do as a fully formed adult, so that wasn__ it. It__ like he truly can__ help himself and needs everything to be self contained so that nobody knows what he__ up to except the people he__ with at the time. It wasn__ just me. He would answer the phone when other people would call and say he was doing something completely different than what we were actually doing right in front of me or he would make up an obligation to avoid real obligations. It was like he was always keeping track of where he was supposed to have been and with who on what day because he was doing this or doing that which was always changing depending on who he was having a conversation with. In retrospect I see how disturbing living your life like that is but at the time I just shrugged it off as just being a fundamental part of who he is and not the result of an obvious personality disorder.   I__ rambling on now about a 6 year shit show, but as I type this I realize now that I needed to do this for catharsis. I apologize for saying I__ be concise and then immediately following with a novel length wall of text, but let me get to the point.   I knew it wasn__ going to go my way when I heard one cop refer to my ex as __he victim_ in a hushed conversation to another officer and I realized they weren__ talking about me. It was like everyone__ demeanor changed at exactly the same time and everyone was staring at me when one of the officers told me to get up and began to read me my rights telling me that I was being arrested. I was in such shock and disbelief that I couldn__ move or speak. I had never felt so helpless in my entire life. Here were the only people I thought could help me and they were treating me like a criminal and calling my ex a victim. He was the victim. It was devastating and I can relive that moment so vividly that it feels real when I think about it. I remember how warm the room was because I cranked the heat. I remember what the room smelled like. I remember what the fabric of the couch felt like against my legs and I remember what the hard wood felt like when I stood up on my bare feet. What I remember the most is the new look in everyone__ eyes. I could tell that nobody there had any intention of believing me, had been patronizing my story just to get information and not because they cared about the situation I was in, and that nobody was going to help me. I__e never felt more alone than in that moment. Helpless. Bullied into being framed as a criminal. I was going to jail. I couldn__ comprehend why or what I said wrong. I was told I was being booked and charged with domestic violence because we both had marks from the struggle we were in earlier and I had been the instigator. I plead not guilty. Then the pandemic hit and my dates have been repeatedly continued over the last year and a half nearly. This happened January 7th of 2020. They wanted me to plead guilty to __hreatening domestic violence_ to avoid a trial but I refused. Why would I plead guilty to something I didn__ do just to avoid a trial for a charge I__ also equally innocent of? What kind of fucked up choice is that to be forced into? Fuck no and fuck that. I decided to take it to trial. The trial has been continued multiple times because of the pandemic. The last date was continued because my ex was on vacation and as a witness to the prosecution, requested a continuance which THEY APPROVED. This has completely destroyed my life. I have had 3 job offers rescinded because the pending charge still shows up on a background check as __omestic violence pending trial_ and I feel like I__ just stuck in place and there isn__ anything I can do about it. I gave up looking for work because I can__ handle another job they hired me and then pulls out the rug from under me when they see my background check. I can__ do that again. My trial is finally going to happen on Tuesday and I am terrified. Terrified of being in a situation again where I have to defend myself in a room full of strangers that I__ being presented to as a criminal and an abusive partner when I__ the victim and I was the one that suffered his abuse for years. Abuse I didn__ even accept as abuse until I enough time and space away from him to see things for what they were and to stop giving him an excuse to rationalize everything he__ done to me. I have no faith that I__l be treated fairly and after what I dealt with when I was arrested I have no hope that anything I say will matter. Obviously this shit happened so I can__ just say it didn__. It just didn__ happen even remotely close to the way he said it did. The only defense my attorney has suggested is self defense and that means that I have to take the stand and tell me story. The thought of having to do this again to people that can choose to not believe me just because they feel like it makes me sick. Ohio is open discovery. I know what the prosecution is presenting and it boils down to he said she said but he__ more a part of our community and he__ an outsider and also they both have marks but he was the one that got arrested so decide with no actual evidence to suggest I__ lying. How has this even gone so far as a trial? Why hasn__ this been dropped? I watched the body cams and the reason I was arrested is because like I had previously mentioned, we went around the shoes and they weren__ knocked over. They decided I was lying about the staircase part of my story altogether because I said he dragged me down the stairs and it wouldn__ have been possible because the shoes weren__ knocked over. When I used the verb dragged I wasn__ being literal as if I was in a cartoon and he was pulling me down by an extremity while i slid flat on my back or stomach. I meant dragged because I was trying to get away while being forcefully pushed and pulled down the stairs against my will. They had never asked me about the dog statue and I learned from the body cams that they assumed it was thrown from the living room and landed at the bottom of the stairs. It never occurred to them that it could have fallen from the window. I didn__ even know any of this until I watched the body cams recently. The prosecution is going to bring this up but he__ decided not to actually present any of the footage in court and I think it__ obvious that he knows it doesn__ really make me look bad. I never become aggressive or belligerent or change my story to the multiple people I talk to while they__e trying to piece everything together. He contradicts himself multiple times to them and he even at one point admits to breaking his own things so I couldn__ use them when he left me at his house to punish me during that previous incident i mentioned. He doesn__ say that he did it to punish me but he admits to doing it but doesn__ give a specific reason and the officer doesn__ question him further about it. He just drops it and moves on and it__ never mentioned again. This is a small town in Ohio outside of Akron with a Republican majority that is not completely rural but isn__ in the city either. I feel not only like the victim of abuse but the victim of a system that is supposed to protect people in situations like this. I feel like the outcome would have been much different if the circumstances were exactly the same but I was a woman and this wasn__ a case involving two gay men and because of that I don__ feel like I__ in a position to receive a fair trial. I feel like I__e lost the trial already and there__ nothing I can do about it. I don__ want a violent charge on my record that will fuck my life up and be a gatekeeper to moving on and success and actually becoming a professional with an career someday. I turn 30 in ten days and this is how I__ leaving my 20s? With nothing but regret and being treated like a criminal after being abused for 6 years? I don__ even know if I have an ultimate point or a question to ask but I don__ know what to do anymore and the anticipation of this trial is eating me alive and it__ not good for my health. I__e lost weight and I don__ sleep or eat and I look frail and I have pretty much abandoned my life. I sit inside my apartment alone every day and try to distract myself with whatever I can but this is no longer sustainable. I guess I need advice on what to do if I__ convicted and even what to do if true justice prevails and does what it__ supposed to do and I win my trial. Because even if I win... the damage is already done and I have been back to and trapped at square one, spinning my wheels for a year and half waiting for this to be over, but with a Boulder of shit slowly crushing me into the ground until there__ no possibility of getting ahead again."
physical,What do I do,Idk what I__ suppose to do   I moved out of my mums house to live with my boyfriend I__e been here for 3 months. Last night he hit me because I wouldn__ give him my phone.

physical,What is it going to take?,"If I know he's abusive, I know he's manipulating me, coercing me and has physically assaulted me then why is it still so hard to leave?  This man is insanely convincing, if he were a politician he'd make it to the top in no time. He's very good at what he does.  However... I will never stop telling my friends and family when something questionable happens with him, I will not stay quiet about the fact he's abusive and a thug. I've looked him in the eyes and told him I know he is those things and yet... I've applied for Clare's Law with my local police after an investigating officer told me I should months ago but will that even be enough?  I must have told him 50 times on Sunday night, whilst looking him dead in the eyes ""I want you to leave, I don't want this relationship anymore.."" and he wouldn't leave until he got the answer he wanted which was ""we'll be okay, we'll see how it goes...""  The threats and name calling are insane and sometime they're terrifying...  It's never going to be easy to leave is it? I'm going to have to do it with the chains still around me aren't I..."
emotional,So many posts I pray someone sees mine.,"If I were to tell my life story , and I've tried, on here it would be way to long. But I'm the.victim of extreme emotional abuse by a npd mother.  I have a brother I destroyed.my relationship and any respect.with mom by protecting him in my twenties while he was growing up.  He graduated h.s went to ohio state. Then didnt even invite me to graduation. I've gone some years where hes sent me nothing but a merry x mas, when I look like a lunatic for messaging him every few weeks just needing someone to talk to.  I'm 33 stuck back at moms. Just realizing she has never approved of any autonomous action around her house that when my dad was alive was all of our home, now it's just hers.   I cant say no I'm figuring out , I think over desperate hear.of approval and fear of being ignored like my.mother has done to me. It's pretty much ruined my.life.   At 33 she does not trust me to do anything around the house that might make things efficient , help her, or organize areas, etc. Only unless directly told.   Today I asked for help in letting me say no, instead I was given the cold unloving shoulder and told nows bot the time as I dont do a damn thing here and she has things I need to do for her( she keeps me on a string with these important tasks, and the one minute I leave she will do them especially dangerous one) knowing that kills me.inside, and I'm so scared of losing another.parent. and I dont even k ow what the request was!  Please someone can you talk to me , I have a therapist. And psych for meds and they cant help me as am beleived to have asbergers and one hour with them doesnt account for 24 hrs a day around her.  Please...  Worst.part is I'm self aware. I know I'm a decent looking guy and smart enough If tried just a little. But I'm so tied into a 65 y o womans life and I think fear of death. I take care.of them before I ever think of me. Due to this, I've lost teeth due to lack.of brushing, would.shower daily and now once every few weeks, I'm so tired all day yet awake and afraid at night. Jobs dont like me as I have a fear of responsibility on my own after ive been I trouble for every attempt at helping at home for someone who daily says they need help"
emotional,He wants to sabotage how i decorate the apartment all of a sudden??? Narcs just find new way to victimize themselves everyday,"If you have ever seen those ""straight male apartment decor"" memes, that is genuinely how he lives and wants his home to look. I am trying to make the apartment pastel, bright, comfortable, subconsiously inducing happy chemicals. He is arguing with me that he wants a black chair but I explain many times it doesn't fit the theme of the apartment (I bought two chairs that do). That's not the only thing he wants. If it were up to him, he wants everything to be ""random/disorganized/completely unmatching"". I sacrifice a lot to make this person feel content in life (which means I suffer a lot internally), I even sleep in my makeup 24/7 so I'm never ugly for him. Anyway. I just want this one thing that brings me joy and feels like myself, where I can put my real personality into something. Everyday I am not allowed to be myself. I'm even secretly realizing I am on the autism spectrum and masking my entire personality for him because any time it peaks through it pisses him off. ANYWAYS SORRY, TANGENT... He expresses that he doesn't even want a black chair, be just doesn't want me to have the final say of the decor. He is purposely trying to spite me and be a victim. WHYYY. Ugh. Please let me have this one thing that is truly the last remnant of me."

emotional,I need help understanding whether if I'm overreacting or if this really is misogynistic?,"If you read my last post, you'll see that my partner can get weird about other people's clothing choices, me included. Something of that sort happened today. We argued, but thankfully I've learned to stand my ground to them, so I managed to prevent the argument from escalating! I feel kind of proud of my self :')  Anyway, I'm copy-pasting the argument from my notes and I'd really appreciate any kind of advice/validation, or even criticism. Tell me if I'm wrong please.  -----  A few days ago, I showed them a pair of frayed denim shorts and asked if they liked them. They implied distaste and basically said it would only be good for sexual purposes, but that the only opinion that matters is mine, and I should wear them if I like them. It was good because this was way more mature than how they used to act. I was happy.  Anyway, today, we were kind of joking around with each other. I showed them the shorts and I was just joking around like ""Teehee you are jealous of my shorts! I luv my shortttss"". I was just poking fun at them.   They said implied that it's only good for one purpose by making a hand gesture implying sex. They said, ""It's just kind of cheap"". I said, ""Whaaaat, how? How does this look sexual?"". They said ""That's just the truth. It doesnt look elegant at all"".  So I calmly said ""I think porn has corrupted you lol"". They immediately got offended and were like ""What, what are you talking about?"".  I took this opportunity to tell them that the language they use in these situations are exaggarated and misogynistic. They said that they ""Hadn't used this language in a long time"", and that I'm ""pointing it out at the first chance"". They said they ""used these words to explain what they mean quickly"".  For context, they said ""In a long time"", because they used to call things trashy, hoe-y, whore-ish, etc, until I continuously called them out for it.  Their first point was not true, because I literally heard them use the word ""crackwhore red"" for a video game character's nail polish earlier today. I hate to admit, but I've let them slip on the crackwhore red word for a while, because they just wouldnt accept that its offensive to say.  Anyway, I explained to them that I'm just telling them what I believe, and that I think they should revaluate their word choices. I said I'm not making a big deal out if it.  I was being super calm, but they got really heated. They were clearly offended. They said I'm nitpicking, making a big deal out of something small, and things of that regard. I kept being calm and asserting my view. So the conversation ended with them saying okay, and continuing to watch the video they were watching. Thats all."

physical,"My sister (31/f) is in an abusive relationship, the girlfriend (38/f) tried to kill herself on my wedding night, how do I (33/f) help or talk to my sister about it?","I'll break this down between some history, and what I am looking for help with. Sorry, it__ long. I__ shortening everywhere I can.   **TW suicide &amp; self-harm.** --- --- *Some history:* --- our family is small; just 4 of us: me, my sister, my mom, and an uncle we never see other than holidays. My sister and I are extremely close despite that I live in another state for the last 5 years, we have always texted all day and talk 3-4 times a week.   My sister met her girlfriend 2.5 years ago in a bar after being broken up with by her longtime non-abusive girlfriend (9'ish years together). She was heartbroken, increased to weekly therapy, dated a bit and was doing really well after about 6 months, she met this girl about a year after the breakup.   --- --- *The relationship and abuse:* ---  long story short, issues my sister brings up most often is the girl gets drunk every night and is an angry/quiet drunk, she texts all the time and hides her phone, and has really intense mood swings that last a few days up, few days down.    They broke up and got back together 4 times for a myriad of reasons: the girl cheating repeatedly, the girl trying to ultimatum me and my mom out of my sister's life ""it's me or them, you obviously don't have a good history with them""; for screaming fights where the cops are called; for the girl admitting she__ married __ust for the benefits_ but still sleeps with the wife, for the girl hiding booze in my sister's drinks to make her stay over when my sister didn__ want to, for the girl trying to force my sister to get rid of her dog. My sister breaks up with her a 4th time and are apart for 6 months.   Covid hits, my sister gets depressed, they begin to text again, eventually, they are back together. Throughout all this, I was talking my sister through how the textbook extremely abusive behavior from the girl. My sister has repeatedly written it off as __ot the (the gf's) fault, it__ her mental illness and childhood trauma_.    --- --- *The suicide attempt:* ---  That brings us to 1 month ago and where my issues with it all come in. My fianc_© and I have been together 13 years and we pushed our huge wedding back a full year due to covid so we aren__ getting married until October 2021. A month ago we decided fuck it, let__ elope to Vegas; we invite our 3 bffs &amp; my sister.    After a long talk and that I didn__ think the girlfriend should come, my sister promises __hings are great we are perfect now_ sure, whatever. Weekend comes, we all arrive, I meet the girlfriend for the first time - she seems shy. I start chatting with her, do a shot with her, make small talk, try to make her feel welcome and part of the group. The girl sits on her own and still seems in her shell, my sister is trying to encourage her to hang out but the chick isn__ into it and just is on her phone.    We all get dressed up, find a random wedding chapel; me &amp; my fianc_© get married, yay fun, then as we are waiting for 2 ubers to take us back to the strip, the group conversation turns to __ho would get married in Vegas next_. My sister says to the gf ____ marry you in Vegas! I love you ___, the girlfriend responds __a. Right. I wouldn__ fucking marry you. Why would I, you keep leaving me._    The ubers pull up right then. We separate them between the ubers, my sister comes with me, she__ sobbing. My friend texts me from the other car, the girlfriend apparently was scream-crying, he and his husband try to calm her down to no avail. When their car parks, the girlfriend takes off running to Excalibur (our hotel) no one follows.    The other uber, our uber, drops us off at NYNY, our friends in the other car call and ask if they should just let the girlfriend leave and my sister yells __es fuck her I__ done, she knows this isn__ her weekend to start a fight_.    We all go drinking elsewhere the rest of the night my sister apologizes a million times, eventually turns off her phone, we get her back to having fun, the night isn__ ruined, and we are rid of the drama girlfriend yay!    My sister and I talk about that I__l get her stuff from the room since she will sleep in our friends_ room instead. Once we get back to the hotel at like 4am, I go to the room for the stuff, the girlfriend wakes up, starts yelling lunges at my sister. My husband, a firefighter who knows how to deescalate due to his job, gets between them, cops and security come knocking, we get them separated and all go to bed.    2 hours later its 6am, we are all asleep, I hear sirens and people yelling in the hall. Knocking at our door starts, it__ the same cops and security, only now flanked by paramedics, they immediately come in, ask questions, cops separate us and we are all confused _ they keep asking what domestic violence happened the night before. Luckily the same cops are back, they believe us when we say we stayed in our rooms after they left earlier.   After 10 minutes of questions, they tell us that the girlfriend had slit her wrists in the bathroom, called 911 on herself, she was stable but lost a lot of blood. My now-husband is a paramedic and went out to talk to the medics more, yep she was bad off and being transported. We spent the rest of the day at the hotel, dealing with security, cops, and hotel manager.    My sister was a mess, had a phone session with her therapist, was very adamant she was done and this was the last straw. Our friends were super supportive and we were trying to salvage the remaining day/night. As far as the girlfriend, I had high hopes and really thought this might be the actual last straw and my sister would be done. NOPE.   We went home the next day, my sister had committed to being our ride to the airport, but then backed out last minute after spending 45 minutes on the phone privately. She left early and in a rush, didn__ tell me anything. The next day we talked, she admits she went to see the girlfriend in the hospital, brought clothes, food, spent a few hours there and then got another hotel room. She drove back the next day and has completely moved in with the girl now.    once I found that out, I asked ""where is the line?? when she attacks you? if she tries again, you try to stop and she hurts you instead? if she tries again? she's already taken your phone multiple times when I call, you don't talk to mom anymore, where is your line??"" my sister kept saying ""I don't know, her mental illness is way too big for me to answer that.""    --- --- *My questions:* ---   What I need help with is how the hell do I talk to my sister about this? We had a pretty good long conversation where I really laid out my feelings the day after we got home, but its been 3 weeks and I am ANGRY and feeling so mega protective.    I initiate every text since this happened because I am scared my sister is going to disappear, officially cut off from me cause I'm so mad, so every conversation it__ been me asking how she is and her telling me her feelings, what her therapist says, how her anxiety is so bad but she __oesn__ know why!_. I got 1 apology during the one phone call, where she also told me she was mad I didn__ let her see the bloody room.   I am her sister, but I__ not her keeper, I cant and don__ want to control her but I want to big-sister this and try to be there for her...but frankly, I__ so fucking mad. I in a way want my sister to see that she has chosen a shitty selfish person who refuses to take care of themself, and under no circumstances will I let that person into my life too. The girl has tried to force my sister to choose ""me or your family"" and i feel like this was that yet again.    I am kicking myself constantly for a lot of my decisions surrounding the weekend, and I__ trying to process it all as it comes up. I have no idea if I should just let my sister initiate conversation if I should bring up my feelings? If I should be the one trying to keep our relationship going or let her see what life is like with this psycho as her partner? I just don__ know. I already made it clear this girl is not welcome in my life at all. She is not allowed at our big wedding next year either obviously.    How do you talk to your sibling about their abusive relationship? How do you advocate for them when they won't for themself and when do you know to stop, and HOW do you stop?? Am I out of line for feeling like me and my husband are owed a huge apology by this girl and my sister?  --- --- **tl;dr**   --- my sister has been in a 2 year on-again-off-again relationship with a woman who has cheated a ton, a heavy drinker, 3 untreated mental illnesses, verbally abusive, has almost completely isolated her from her friends family and dog, and physically abused her on 2 occasions that my sister opened up about.   My now-husband and I secretly eloped in Vegas 3 weeks ago with our 3 friends and my sister &amp; girlfriend there, and while there this girl tried to commit suicide in the bathroom after a fight with my sister after being confronted about cheating yet again. My sister took her back, I have no idea how to talk to my sister or how to proceed."

emotional,Emotional abuser wanting to get better,"I'll keep this short, in case I'm not welcome here. I have found myself at a place in life of realizing I have been an emotionally abusive partner, which has destroyed multiple deeply meaningful relationships.

I don't want to be the kind of person that hurts the people I love. My question is, do you know of any good online resources or communities that are meant to help people recover from their own abusive behavior?

emotional,I think I have emotionally abused my partner,"I'll try and make this as short as possible. Me and my ex broke up around 5 months ago and was together for a year. I loved him with my whole heart and he was the most important person in my life. In the beginning he kept saying he didn't want titles. He is 24 and never been seriously involved with a girl. He was very indecisive, from takeout choices, to his WIFI supplier, it would take him a long time to decide on anything so I never rushed him or put pressure. I wasn't involved with anyone else and happily waited. He kept ending it with me if I ever asked to see him more, or if I said something he didn't like, once a month he would end it roughly. He said I didn't do enough for him. So after I would travel to his place, 2hrs on public transport, I'd cook for him, do his cleaning. Bring baked brownies and cakes for him in my bag. There was a time before xmas last year that he ended it with me in the middle of the night and said I had to leave in the morning, this was because I said to him if he kept treating me how he was, he would be lonely and he needed to change his ways. When I woke up I was so upset and didn't want to travel on a tube home whilst crying. I begged him to let me stay and he put his earphones in and played his PS4 and ignored me. He got into bed that evening, we had sex, fell asleep then he woke me at 1am and told me to leave. So I got an Uber back to my home 2hrs away. I begged for days and said how sorry I was.  We moved in together in March this year and I was lonely sometimes and missed my family. I would tell him and he would say he felt trapped and like he could never leave me. He worked 15hr shifts so I only really saw him at 6am or at 10pm when he came home from work. I always said he should work and I've always respected his work ethic. We argued in April and I touched his shoulder whilst he had earphones in and was ignoring me, and he said I pulled his shoulder out of place. The next day I was packing some clothes to go to my parents and threw an item in anger because we was arguing. He was in the living room and I threw it towards the kitchen. He said I wasn't strong enough to reach him and that it was my aim. He called our landlord and said he was in danger, unsafe and had to leave. My landlord declined.  He moved out and came back 4 days later after I stopped begging. He then ended it a month later on my bday. He took condoms out on my birthday eve and told me this was so he could sleep with another girl. The next day I tried to talk to him and he was on our sofa with his earphones in, ignoring me whilst I was crying and apologising. I touched his arm to get his attention to say I understood and I was sorry and he sat up, told me I had harrassed him, assaulted him by touching his arm without consent and said he would record me so people saw what he was dealing with. He said being with me made him want to self harm so I could see how unhappy he was. I was worried as I thought what about if he sends it to our landlord, to his friends, what about if they think I'm abusive and have driven him to self harm. I asked to speak to his mum as she was lovely and he wouldn't let me. I called my mum and she said to google if I can stop the landlord opening the video, or stop my bf sending it. Google advised to call 101. I did that and they sent 2 officers. I told the officers I was afraid I had hurt him, was scared that the video would make people believe I had abused him and that I was worried he may self harm. I never said a bad word about him. They made my bf leave for the night but said he could come back in the morning.  He moved out and ended it. This was 5 months ago. I begged and cried and was so so apologetic as I felt awful. He blocked me, unblocked, made me hand my notice in. Came back for sex, accused me of trying to trap him. Told me I tried to ruin his life with the police etc. Came back again, wanted to record our sex, wanted me to dress up for him. Asked me to cook for him, and massage him. I am back at my parents now and have seen him 4 times in the 2 months our place has been gone. He has told me 4-5 times I am dangerous and he wants to stop seeing me, that he cant forget what I done. He doesn't understand I done it because I wanted to protect myself. Each time he has come back, but this time he said I keep begging and then when I message him after giving him space he starts feeling things again and thats when things with us go back to how they was and we start speaking. He said he never wants to talk to me again and that he never wants to see me again. I feel like all my begging has taken a toll and I've abused him"
emotional,is it bad if your parents dont let you go to a specialist for a mental disorder?,"im 14, and my parents are very abusive and they dont care about mental illnesses, but today my mom yelled at me because i didnt eat an egg for breakfast. and when i told her she didnt eat one either, she said i was her daughter and she had responsibility about the way i ate. but now i think that i have ADHD  because i have and have had many symptoms for a long time now, but if i told her i wanted to go to a specialist, she would for sure yell at me because she needs to be the center of attention 24/7. she has been abusive for a while now, but i feel like sometimes she cares about me only to be a good mother in the eye of public because how is not eating an egg bad parenting and not being responsible? someone please tell me if im wrong."
physical,I think right now talking to someone who gets it would really help so please pm me if you are feeling up to it,"I'm 16F, I feel so fucking stuck &amp; just miserable as hard as I try not to be. I have a family of six; dad, mum, sister 27, sister 12 &amp; nephew 3 although my older sister &amp; nephew no longer live in the same house as the rest of us. Moved out twoish months ago.   My mum has always been abusive ever since being a child but she's been particularly abusive to her children, &amp; husband at times. She tried to kill my older sister when she was three y/o &amp; threatened to kill me when I was one y/o, I think those are the worst times she's been abusive as I think there's no other times she's been genuinely homicidal. She used to physically abuse me until I lost my shit &amp; I guess she was afraid I'd tell someone. She's always been abusive in every way but sexual &amp; now still every way but sexual &amp; physically although she does use lots of physical intimidation? She's just fucking NASTY. she's evil. I've never liked her. She's pushed us all to our literal breaking points expect my little sieter &amp; nephew( attempting suicide, self harm &amp; drugs).  For all my life she made me feel worth as much as the shit on your shoe &amp; just pathetic, hopeless, disgusting. Im learning bit by bit to take better care of myself.. Being in therapy has helped but it's really hard to over come especially when it comes from the person who's meant to make you feel invincible time to time.  I don't want to bore you with all the ins &amp; outs, even though venting every single bit out would be nice but I just feel so fucking heavy &amp; confused that I burst in to tears any second. I did it today on a beach infront of my friends &amp; people I'd just met. I most likely can't move in with my sister as planed, it'd be very complicated to move in with my best friends &amp; I can't live with my boyfriend because his mum has cancer &amp; they're struggling enough as it is. Me moving in with these people would put them at danger of my mum, as well as my younger sister &amp; dad being in danger. I don't want to live in a share house because I don't want to leave my sister or even my dad behind &amp; I don't want to take up space that someone else may need more than me. I don't know what to do. Who to go to. How to cope. I'm just crying heaps; I'm someone who tries hard to look at things from a realistic but still hopeful lense &amp; this is beating me down. I'm surprised I haven't relapsed in self harm, I dont want to have to look at it &amp; regret it or upset anyone I guess. But I'm so fucking miserable right now asuch as I hate to admit it.  So please. If there's anyone who can offer any advice or I can talk to who gets it, I appreciate you so so much."

For all my life she made me feel worth as much as the shit on your shoe &amp; just pathetic, hopeless, disgusting. Im learning bit by bit to take better care of myself.. Being in therapy has helped but it's really hard to over come especially when it comes from the person who's meant to make you feel invincible time to time.  I don't want to bore you with all the ins &amp; outs, even though venting every single bit out would be nice but I just feel so fucking heavy &amp; confused that I burst in to tears any second. I did it today on a beach infront of my friends &amp; people I'd just met. I most likely can't move in with my sister as planed, it'd be very complicated to move in with my best friends &amp; I can't live with my boyfriend because his mum has cancer &amp; they're struggling enough as it is. Me moving in with these people would put them at danger of my mum, as well as my younger sister &amp; dad being in danger. I don't want to live in a share house because I don't want to leave my sister or even my dad behind &amp; I don't want to take up space that someone else may need more than me. I don't know what to do. Who to go to. How to cope. I'm just crying heaps; I'm someone who tries hard to look at things from a realistic but still hopeful lense &amp; this is beating me down. I'm surprised I haven't relapsed in self harm, I dont want to have to look at it &amp; regret it or upset anyone I guess. But I'm so fucking miserable right now asuch as I hate to admit it.  So please. If there's anyone who can offer any advice or I can talk to who gets it, I appreciate you so so much."
emotional,Am i being abused?,"I'm 17 year old boy and i live with my mom and dad, my father abuses alcohol and my mother doesn't drink often, but when she does she becomes unintelligible and has the mental capacity of a toddler, i don't mean this as an insult i just don't have any other way to describe it. i've been surrounded by weed, booze and cocaine for most of my life.  I've also been really dissociated from life, i feel mostly detached my father because he's the one that drinks more often, he frequently has 2/3 day alcohol benders and it's disgusting, I have little regards for him as a person and i don't really consider him a important part of my life for this reason, the times when he's sober it's just him being angry and upset because of a hangover.  Because of how i am with him he thinks i have some sort of hidden agenda which i don't really understand, he insults me and tells me i have the social skills of my 5 year old sibling because i decide to not communicate or show emotions with him, he used to insult me all the time when i was a kid, i've just dealt with it  I've been dealing with this all of my life and i don't know what this means for me, is this a normal household? Am i in a safe environment for my mental health? I'm not aware of any if this because this is what i've had all my life. Until recently it has started to make me feel sick and disgusted, i've also dealt with depression ever since i became a teenager, and i'm worried that this is the cause why i'm always upset   TL;DR i don't know if my household is abusive, my parents abuse alcohol and party all of the time, been depressed most of my teen years."
emotional,How to explain my shut down of feeling anything sexual,"I'm 17 years into my marriage with my husband who has a very long history of lying and cheating. I always know when he is doing it because I can ""feel"" it and I've always been right about it. This time I'm just trying to keep the house peaceful, if I make any comments that sound like I'm ""questioning"" him he erupts in a rage that escalates until he sleeps it off, sometimes lasting into the next day when I greet him with a nice hello or good morning and he pretends I don't exist like a child playing that their friend isn't there. He is very childish and angry all the time when guilt tries to trip him up. Anyway, I'm not asking for advice on how to leave him or anything. I have ZERO feelings of anything sexual. It's like the entire sexual side of me has disappeared.  He gets angry about that also but I honestly can't find it anymore. The advice I'm looking for is, how do you explain that in a way that makes sense to the abuser? Where it is, these are the consequences of your choices, your words, your actions, your patterns? I've stopped owning things that aren't mine to own. When I felt like a partner with him, we had a great life. We always do, until he stops everything in our relationship again and then makes me feel annoying for asking where it went and can we get it back?  To which he replies, ""I don't know, can YOU?"" ____"
physical,My home is making me aggressive.,"I'm 17 years old. The household I live in has always been explosive, so to say. My mother had abusive parents with alcohol problems, and my dad lost two of his father figures. That made her aggressive and short-fused and him somewhat distant and cold. Not only that, but because of my brother's health problems and later death, they've been absent for the beginning part of me growing up, and that made us grow apart a little bit. I've never been one to talk about emotion, especially with them, and if I have ever shown any strong ones, it's been made fun of or disapproved, which led to some mental breakdowns on my part. With that said, I've been screamed at and criticized for my whole life. I always failed expectations and comparisons and I was never enough, even when I succeeded. There never was any violence, but my mom always seemed to unwind on me or blame me for certain things. She tends to get out of control, and with age, I endure those moments gradually worse. What scares me is, I'm starting to get those outbursts of aggression too, basically fighting fire with fire. And I hate that, as I can't even really control it anymore. As a kid, I always said that I would never be like her towards people, especially if I have any children, but I'm starting to worry it might be out of my control, as I'm slowly losing the breaks. And I despise myself for it, as it's the ugliest feeling in the world like I'm rotting at the core, becoming what I feared. Even the slightest things tend to frustrate me nowadays. Is there any way to stop this? Or at least, control me during those moments?  PS: It's not like I don't love them, or we're not living on a good level - it's just that all of this weighs down on me, I shouldn't be anyone's therapist, especially my mother's, and I don't want to endure this anymore."
physical,Broken home baby,I'm 18 years old and I have never had a proper relationship with my family . My dad is an alcoholic and a deadbeat even though he lives in the same home with me he never bothered to love me or treat me like his daughter. One day he was drunk and started getting abusive with my mother I always try to save her and push him off. Well he fought back at me and spat on me and told me I'm worthless and not good of a daughter.  My mom tried comforting me but it wasn't enough. I tried running away several times but always ended up coming back because I'm young and don't want to be kidnapped. I'm trying to stay strong and get a job to start saving up but I haven't been so lucky lately. It triggers me sometimes because he can go weeks without being abusive then out of nowhere the monster in him comes out. I expressed myself heavily to my mom about how I was going to leave and being here at home isn't worth it . I started smoking to cope with the pain and my mom found out and called me the devil and insisted I move out asap. She's always quick to push me away but not my dad. Everytime the cops gets called she lies for him and pretends she's ok. I just can't take any of this anymore I never felt like I had a childhood. All I ever wanted and asked for was a happy family and for someone to love me .
emotional,My dad is hot headed and everything that disagrees with what he thinks makes him angry,"I'm 19[M] and I don't understand the relationship that I have with my dad. I don't know if we have a bond at all. He's always working hard to provide for me, my mom and my brother but when it comes to personal matters it's difficult. I never had someone that I could talk to about my feelings in a safe place in my family. I don't trust my family enough for that because I've been told countless times that what I felt was just because I was a teenager or that I was making excuses.  I'd love to invite my gf over to celebrate 8 months together but I asked him once and I couldn't talk anymore because I felt as he shut me for good. I felt fear and a lot of sadness that I gulped and acted as nothing happened.  After dinner and such we were playing a cards again and I felt my emotions boiling up and just couldn't take it anymore. I went to my room and just layed on my bed doing nothing because I just needed to be alone and away from everyone.  I have no idea of how to interact with him because it gives me the chills when he looks at me with his glaring squinting his eyes, looking as angry as ever and it scares me so much it's making me tear up now. I just can't speak and the only thing that I feel is this deep sadness that makes me cry even if I don't want to.   I don't want to diagnose myself or whatnot. Every time someone raises their voices I get triggered and I just can't help feeling sad and tearing up and a hard pain on my chest."
emotional,Did I care too much??,"I'm 22 years old and I take care of my grandma. I cloth, bathe, feed and take care of appointments and medicine. She has always verbal/ physical abused me for my whole life so I have no boundaries. My brother and sister only help sometimes and she respects them more than me, I don't argue with her do whatever she. Asks even if I am tired they can say no to her but me nope.  I self-harm to deal with stress, anxiety,depression and ADHD the family knows about my therapy but don't care to change. They just label me as ""sensitive"" and ""having mood swings"". Maybe if I was more self centered I wouldn't have been this way?"
physical,I'm in great pain.,"Im 24. Aside from being sexualized by my father from a young age. My father has always shamed me for everything. From wearing unfashionable clothes to day to day minor mistakes like spilling water. He would also shame me for eating out of his pocket. Shame me for having to pay tuition. And shamed me for being sick and have to pay for medicine. As I grew older, the more I realized I didn't deserve all that cruel treatment and it kills me.  Now I have absolute no self esteem. Scared all the time and always on the verge of ... The hate consumes me constantly.  But since I don't have a good financial support I can't even move out of the house to escape him. I have to see that bastard everyday and it kills me. My mother does absolutely nothing but to stand by and watch. I can't go to therapy either because I could lost my job from where I live (not us).  Everyday I'm torn to shreds. Please please please help me."
emotional,Leaving husband and he's making it very difficult. I could really use some encouragement and advice.,"I'm 41f, he's 57m. We have been together 19 years, married for 17, have 2 kids, ages 6 and 8. I figured out 18 months ago that our issue was emotional abuse, confronted him, and asked for a divorce. He has changed a lot, claims he is no longer abusive (I don't ever know how to pinpoint how his behaviour is abusive, he's very covert), and I mean things aren't at all like they used to be, that's true. For background, we were seemingly the perfect couple, everything was so perfect, except when every once in a while we'd have brutal 2-3 day 'episodes' where everything would be turned upside down, I'd be accused of being a horrible person, not caring, being selfish, treating him horribly, for days. Then I'd get lots of apologies and need days to recover. These became more and more frequent, then became the norm, you get the idea.   Our situation is tricky because I am the primary bread winner and he's been the primary caregiver since the youngest was 1. He has his own business and has a seasonal job in the summer which has taken him out of the city 5 days a week in the past. This past summer it was cancelled because of Covid. The business is growing but doesn't make a tonne of $ yet and requires him to work insane hours, plus I help, a LOT. I know I shouldn't, but I want the business to grow and succeed so that we are able to afford two households. It's been 1.5 years because we're shoring up funds, but also because he keeps asking me to stay longer. Originally I was supposed to move out Jan 1. He told me he wouldn't ask for me to stay after our talk, Jan 1 and that's that. Then he asked for a 3 month extension again, and promised not to try to convince me to stay during that time. He has, multiple times, he did it Monday and it was a horrible day, and again today. He guilts me by saying this will devastate the kids, and today he told me he will have to give up his business and his summer job if I leave because of all the help I currently provide and because he is unwilling to sacrifice what little time he will have with the kids (we are planning 50/50) for either the business or the summer job. he will have to find a steady 9-5 somehow. He tells me he doesn't mean to guilt me, he is simply stating the facts, the business can not continue as it has, he's sorry that he isn't able to come up with a way to talk about this with me without making me feel guilty.   I don't know how to respond to any of this. It fills me with panic and crushing guilt, like I am destroying the kids, his business, and his dream summer job, by leaving. The guilt trips are brutal and I end up feeling exactly like I felt before I confronted him, just like during one of our 'episodes', panicked, confused, like I'm in a fight or flight mode, heart racing, body tense, the works. I don't know if what he is doing is abusive, he claims no, and I know I can't trust him, but he's very intelligent and I am not half the arguer he is. It feels like it is, but I suppose it might just be trauma response to behaviour that would historically lead to abusive behaviour.   I have an apartment and March 1 is my move in date. I got the place in January and have been working on making it a home for me and my kids because I think it's important for all us to have a comfortable place to land. Like...it's way too late. I don't know why he's still trying to convince me to stay. But it's brutal to deal with him. I guess I could use validation that this IS a crushing thing for someone to say, that I can't possibly be responsible for all of his success/happiness, that I am not being selfish...I don't know. Maybe advice on what to remember, what to think, what too say, when he does this again. Because I know he will. 5 weeks. I don't know how I will be able to do this."

physical,I Don't Think They're Sorry (Should I Leave?),"I'm a 36 year old male and my wife is 32 and diagnosed bipolar I. We have been married for two years and have dated for ten years prior.  I have decided to move out and see how things go with my wife while I work on codependency. I've been having emotional &amp; physical numbness and trust issues with almost everybody I know. My social circle is very small. My wife, father, mother, sister and best friend are all the people I have in my life on a frequent basis but the relationships with my family is toxic.  My wife and I have had a past that's included insults, asking me to have an open relationship with other men, cold shoulders, insults in front of family members and physical attacks to name some of the things I've went through. She's forgotten most of it. Maybe she forgot it due to her bipolar. I wish I could forget.  I've been reading online about ""changes"" an abuser can make found here: [https://www.thehotline.org/resources/is-change-possible-in-an-abuser/](https://www.thehotline.org/resources/is-change-possible-in-an-abuser/)  There are steps provided here that I feel like aren't being met, specifically ""Accepting the consequences of their actions (and not blaming)."" I'm looking to see if people agree as I'm in a dark, foggy place and have no idea if I am right or my trust issues from the abuse are to blame.  She had texted and asked if I could come by and check on a dog that we had gotten just before I moved out. I remember her telling me that I could come by whenever I needed and that she was worried the puppy being by himself. We hadn't talked for two days and I couldn't remember when she was off, so I swung by to make sure that he was okay and I caught her as she had just pulled up. I asked her if she had gotten my text from a few hours ago because I didn't just want to swing by unannounced, although she had told me in the past that she was ""right down the street"" if I was having a hard time. ""Me and Chase have been out all day."" She told me as we walked up and into the apartment.  The last time she hit me (and the ""reason"" I left), occurred after she had woken me up and I was laying in bed. She told me about how she made a bag for Chase. After that she asked me ""why I didn't put the towels in the washer last night"" to which I replied that she didn't tell me to. She got defensive and I said ""Oh, well I guess I didn't hear you."" Before I knew it she was punching me while I laid in bed. I wasn't hurt at all but the vulnerability of laying in bed and unable to defend myself really hit me hard.  We had somehow gotten on the conversation of that attack again. I told her that I haven't been able to feel, other than crying when I thought of her and she told me that was to be expected of a victim of abuse. She never said sorry or consoled me. When I asked if she brought it up in her individual therapy she said that she ""brought it up"" and left it at that. I mentioned about some steps I read about online on recovery from that and that I thought it was important to focus on that as well as couples therapy.  She explained that she hadn't taken care of herself that morning and started talking about how I am cranky in the morning. I told her I didn't want to hear my involvement and it lead into an argument. Ultimately she asked for the apartment key back and asked that I didn't just ""show up unannounced"" (although I was swinging by to check on ""our"" dog). I feel like it's just another power play."
emotional,Governmental gaslighting tactics are triggering,"I'm a survivor of emotional abuse, and even though it's been years, the trauma creeps back in sometimes. My ex was incredibly manipulative and would constantly gaslight me, which made me feel absolutely crazy. While I was with him, I genuinely believed I had lost my mind.   Now during this pandemic, it's pretty obvious that a lot of governments have failed in trying to get things under control. One of my government officials has been lying and gaslighting the public for months on end now about how he's been handling the pandemic. Just recently, his gaslighting was so obvious and extreme that something in me snapped. I again felt like I was going crazy. Something about how he was addressing the public and trying to gaslight us just took me back and triggered really dark memories, and it honestly sent me into a bit of a spiral.   I don't know if I'm the only one who has ever been triggered like this, or what, but it's something I've been thinking about a lot lately. I hated being made to feel like I was crazy by my ex, and I cannot stand to being made to feel the same way by my own government. Has anyone else ever felt something similar?"
physical,Struggling &amp; scared,"I'm beyond overwhelmed with life at the moment. I was with my ex for almost a year. Things were perfectly fine in the beginning; sunshine and rainbows like most relationships are in the first two months. We get a place together. Things are going well then out of nowhere he changes.. He had invaded my privacy by going through my phone when I was asleep. He read things way before his time, before I even knew he existed. Also, saw the thread between my best friend and I when I needed to vent/talked about my struggles. At that point I couldn't talk to anyone anymore. I had to pretend everything was okay and put on the fake 'i'm happy face'. We had got a security system for our place due to not living in the best neighborhood. We had a camera in the bedroom and he'd chime in to watch/listen to me when he was at work to make sure I wasn't talking to anyone. Our how was still getting fixed up and the bedroom was the only finished room. Even if I went to the living room or to get fresh air outside he'd get upset. It would notify him every time I would open a door in the house; he even got upset over me ordering food and having to open the door to get it. It got to the point where I didn't even want to get on any physical level. He would always get upset and say he has ""needs"" then accuse me of things if I didn't go with it. It got to the point where i'd just say ""fine, whatever"" just to get him to stop. Supposedly, i'd tell him to remind me that I was happy when it was over with (his words). Things just continued to get worse. I couldn't talk to my friends. I couldn't even talk to my mom about things unless I went to the bathroom. I had to even come up with a code word with my best friend and my mom; sending them happy messages then dropping the code meaning i'm not okay. I just wanted to escape but I felt so trapped. I tried to leave a few times but then i'd get sucked back in with false promises of change and lies. Manipulation at it's finest. One night, we got in a fight. He told me to get out and he was done with me. So I went to my friends in panic mode, who happens to be an ex (we decided it was best to just be friends since we were friends prior to that relationship). Nothing happened. I'm not the type of person to just go out and do whatever because i'm upset. All that happened was him holding me while I was freaking out and crying. He didn't know I went there, he thought I had went home. In panic I called my mom to tell her to ignore him; it was in the middle of the night and he was harassing my family and friends. My mom said I was at home because of how crazy he was being. After a night of not sleeping and overwhelmed emotions, my friend said I could move in until I get things sorted on where to live; just a temporary stay so I wouldn't be trapped anymore. My ex was constantly texting/calling me all night and day. Crazy one moment and nice the next. He told me that he needed a ride to court and how he was afraid he would be taken to jail for breaking the rules of corrections by drinking two days ago at work (which was a lie). I just felt like a terrible person at that point. So I agreed to take him. I had just got a new car and my friend wanted to try it out. I told him he could drive me down the street to the gas station since I needed to fill up anyways. After that I was heading to my ex's place to drive him to court. My friend kept calling me when I was driving and I didn't answer due to driving. I get there and he just starts sobbing. He said he had been raped in prison and that's why he acted the way he did, ""wanted to feel more like a man""). Which ended up being another manipulated lie; he confessed later on. I was in silence and told him we needed to get him to court. Since I wasn't sure on the fasted way to get there I let him drive. Come to find out my friend had left his wallet in my car and he found it. He started going crazy. He grabbed my phone for me; it was a fight for it. He called him and even my friend said nothing happened. He went into court as I stayed in the car just freaking out. Everything went fine for him; he was saying how inconsiderate I was for not going in there because he could have possibly went to jail. We get back to his place and I had called my grandma to come over to help me move some stuff out. She shows up and he acts crazy in front of her. Crying and begging for me not to leave. Making false promises. He even tried to give my grandma money just to leave. I got so overwhelmed I said i'd stay. He told me he'd get me drugs if I stayed. I am a recovering addict from opiates. At that time I didn't care about life. I was in a bad place and I just wanted an out. I wanted to forget about everything that was happening around me. I cave and he gets me fentanyl. Every dose I wished it would just take me. After baiting me back with drugs with in two weeks he went back to the way he was acting before. I decided to get clean on my own; my one slip up in a year. I threw everything I had away. I wanted a clear head, I just wanted to come up with a plan to leave. One night, I decided I want to go out to the bar and to see old friends. I start getting ready then he comes home from work. He had promised me we'd go soon and I was just asking him if he wanted to go. He then just got very angry. I couldn't deal with it. I told him i'd go whether he was going or not, i'd find a way there and a way back (I was letting him drive my car at the time). I continued to get ready. I grabbed a pair of leggings and a big dad sweater; usual attire. I put on eyeliner and mascara. He started accusing me of things because I ""never looked that good for him"", saying I was going to meet up with someone at the bar. I told him to drop me off since I don't believe in driving even after one drink. On the way there my music was shuffling on spotify and apparently every song was a ""hint of me going to meet up with a guy"". I didn't realize NWA was a ""look i'm going to cheat"" group.. I get there and I felt free at least for the night. I run into old friends and tell them the situation. Like good friends would say, they told me to get out of there. I told them I was scared. I eventually built up the liquid courage and had a plan.   I went home and told him that I can't be there anymore for the sake of my mental health. He doesn't take this well at all then accusing me of meeting some guy at the bar and wanting to run away with him. He told me we could go get married right now and live happy together. I kept telling him no.    I started packing my things while he cried. I had my family meet me there and I started moving everything I possibly could in one trip. I finally got out. I moved in with my grandma for the time being. But I still had a problem; finances shared with him. He's on a klarna payment plan for a laptop and on my phone plan for the next year or so. So I have to continue communication with him.. To fast forward this long read, I felt terrible and decided to go hang out with him one day. He acted how he did when we first met. I thought maybe things had changed but it was just a manipulation tactic to get me to move back in. I was just a silent, depressed mess. Things ended up happening and I just cried my eyes out afterwards in regret. I just wanted to leave. I started packing my things then tried to collect myself before the drive home. I ended up falling asleep. I woke up, went home, then Halloween came around. He told me he wanted to go out to the bar with me, he'd pay for all my drinks, etc. I was still in the confused headspace and agreed even though I knew it most likely wasn't a good idea. So I went. Everyone was in shock when they saw us together like I expected. The alcohol just made me forget all the terrible things that had happened. We have a good night then the next day it hits me. I have made a terrible mistake. I'm in panic and go home. I haven't seen him since then but he continues to try to talk to me. I end up caving and talking to him because i'm scared he's not going to pay the bills he's on (phone plan &amp; klarna). Every time we talk he ends up doing the thing where he says ""he's the only one who's ever truly loved me"", ""no ones ever going to accept me for who I am"", ""no ones going to want to put up with my health issues"". Basically, telling me no ones ever going to love me again. It really hurts, I know that isn't true but it feels like it's never ending. I know people just say to stop talking to him but i'm just scared. I have bad ptsd from domestic violence in a previous relationship. I'm terrified of what can happen if I just block him out. My mom said she would talk to him and handle the bills but i'm afraid he's not going to pay (the phone plan is in her name and I cannot handle him screwing her over). We've tried to get him off the phone plan. He said that he owes at&amp;t money and they won't accept him (not sure how true that is). I just feel stuck. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry this rant is so long. I just needed to vent. For the record, I wasn't perfect through out this relationship; I struggled with my mental health issues and maintaining sobriety. Granted, I never cheated or anything along those lines. He's still controlling me even though i'm not there anymore. I'm scared and still hurt. I want him out of my mind, I want to move on and not feel this daily pain. If you've read this far, thank you. I just wanted to be heard some how with out talking to people that would potentially spread this to him and I deal with the backlash.      Moral of the story: I'm struggling and scared. I don't know what to do. .-."
emotional,Should i move out or continue with autism mental health therapy,"Im extremely depressed at home, im 24 living at home, cannot leave house unless its for work purposes. my mom constaltly calls me a whore, she mentally and physically abuses my dad who is the sole breadwinner. Im thinking of contemplating either moving out when i save up 20k which is in abt 5 months from now or searching for a job(other than the one i have now, cannot stick to it bc mother will stalk me here) and starting to plan to move out (ill have abt 8k when i move out if i start planning now). What do u guys think therapy is of no help its truly my living conditions that is making me suicidal. sometimes its fine i dont have freedom so what i can just play games, but then i get triggered when my mom calls me a whore in an extremly mentally abusive way that i get suicdal. i may be at my breaking point im experiencing back pain, heart aches, a lot of suicdal thoughts. Also im getting therapy now for my autism behind my parents back during lunch break at work and its rather expensive, this is why im asking this group what choice would be better for me to quit therapy and move out would that be better for my mental heatlh  so should i move out now (will have approx 8k )(quit therapy to save money) or wait till i have 20k(5 months frm now)(and get therapy)"

My abuser has been crying and telling me how terrible I am, but then when I was doing my makeup, barges into the bathroom and goes without asking. Slams the door in my face, to which I got angry and opened the door to express how fucking ridiculous that is.   (Warning, revolting) Guys. He dipped his hand in his shit and waved it at me, asking if this is what I wanted to see. I told him to get out right that second. I just cannot believe this. Idk if he's leaving or not, I left. I'm just so disgusted and don't know how to deal."
emotional,I'm new to Reddit. What has a narcissistic emotional abuser said to you in the past?,I'm going through a tough time with this and wanted to know what others' experience has been with someone who does this in a relationship setting. Any particular statements you can quote (anonymously of course)? This is a great way to build a community and support each other with coping.
emotional,When should you accept help?,"I'm in a messed up situation. I live with my (previously?) abusive ex and his new girl.  At this point, He's not as abusive to me as he used to be. There's just occasional meanness from both of them. For the most part, they ignore me.   That said, I'm pretty well being financially used by both of them (I pay for 60% of rent and utilities). This obviously sucks, but it also limits my options to get out of this situation as rent and utilities (not including food, transport, etc) eats up half my monthly pay. Plus, I have a lease that isn't up until next fall. There's a decent chance   But, I do have some friends who are very much willing to help me get out of the situation.  I guess, I don't want to accept their help because I don't feel like this situation is bad enough to cause such a fuss?   I'm (mostly) perfectly fine waiting out the next 8 months. How do you know when to accept help?"
physical,"I recently went no contact with my abusive ex, but I find myself mostly angry at my abusive family now?","I'm just a little confused and overwhelmed. It's like I blame my parents for making me think trauma bonding was love in the first place, and I'm so angry at them. I spend hours lying in bed thinking of all the things I'd say to them, how things would go down if I tried to assert boundaries, etc.  At first I was mad at my ex too, but any and all anger I had for him always somehow split off into anger at my father specifically.  When I was with my ex I'd often consider him the lesser of two evils, and I'm starting to fall back into that again I think.  I don't want to be alone. I don't want to face my family alone, even if the person I had previously faced them with never even really had my back...  Is this normal? Like, to realize in leaving an abusive situation that your problems run so much deeper than you or thought? How do you deal with it?"

physical,Mom is abusing my Dad,"I'm looking for guidance from anyone who has gone through something similar more like this. For some brief context, this is in reference to my my parents and I am their adult daughter. My father called me this afternoon scared and frightened and unsure of what to do. My mother was what we have referred to as the ""gone off the deep end"", in reference to her being verbally abusive and controlling. My mother was off on another of her episodes of extreme anger and was verbally abusing him and apparently now physically abusing him. I have suspected for a while that she was starting to physically assault him, but today on that call he was crying that she had hit him again. I've come to terms with the fact that my mom is very mentally unstable and I will likely never forgive her for this treatment towards my gentle father or have meaningful relationship with her. I worry for my father who is kept isolated with no friends or family other than my brother and I for support. They are  owners of small business together, have joint finances, share one vehicle, One cell phone. I have no way of spending any alone time with him. There is no separation in their lives financially or personally. He would like to go to counseling but my mother refuses and has refused as long as I can remember. I know as I would like some advice as from a person that maybe is gone through something similar. I don't know how to help him other than just be supportive over these phone calls or text messages that I receive randomly during times of his extreme anxiety and distress.  During these phone calls I try to tell him how much I love him and will support him. That he is not bothering me to call and that I am glad he called. I don't know if there's anything more I can do. he doesn't know what to do himself."
physical,Has anyone lost friendships over their DV DV relationship?,"I'm nervous posting my stuff so if I delete it please understand. I just need to vent. I can't get to detailed about my story because it was very unique and very identifiable. Basically, I was strangled, raped, broken bones. Self esteem ripped to shreds. I am actually still being harrassed occasionally to this day. I was very confident and successful pre relationship. I am just wondering if anybody lost friends? I feel like it took me a long time to even function as a human after finally leaving. I basically laid in bed for 2 years because I was so depressed and had daily panic attacks. I went to work and did what I needed to do for my kids to meet basic needs. I started slowly feeling ok about a year ago. I started getting out of my bed and  then started to socialize more. I recently started enjoying my hobbies I had pre DV. I know I am not the same as I used to be and probably never will be but I am doing so much better. It took a ton of work to get where I am now. I didn't tell my friends about what was happening to me when I was in the relationship. I eventually did but I feel like I was so distraught and not myself my best friend could not process it. Today she basically said she doesn't want to be my friend anymore and we have been friends since we were young. I am devastated. I can't stop crying and feel like I caused it because I was so stuck at the time. I know I isolated myself and can't help but think I caused it by being depressed. I really need her. I just want to be normal again. I want to just go back to myself and she us part of myself. I started to feel like I was getting back on track and now I feel depressed again. I didn't mean to be depressed. I was so bad I was suicidal at one point. Has anyone else lost friends because of going through this? I feel so alone."

emotional,Intense Emotion and Fragility as a Young Adult,"I'm not sure how common this is, but has anyone else experienced huge spikes of emotion and feelings of fragility in their early adulthood?  I knew for years that what my brother and I went through wasn't normal per se, but after a point, I quit feeling anything about it, at all. Now that I'm finally in therapy and working through everything, I've started experiencing spurts of intense emotion. It started in relation to specific memories, but now any thought of my parents or of myself as a child is enough to trigger it. The emotion is usually spells of heavy grief mixed with guilt; my parents weren't (and aren't) bad people, just poor parents, and I feel awful thinking that when others (including them) have had it much worse. And sometimes I feel fragile? Like I'm simultaneously very young and very old, and terribly easy for people to break time and time again. I didn't used to feel this way. It's all very confusing and draining, and I wish it would stop.  Has anyone experienced something similar, or does anyone have any advice to work past all of this?"
emotional,Mom only supporting me in things she likes,"I'm not sure if this is legitimately a sign of abuse, or if I'm just spoiled and dramatic, but my mom only really helps me with things I can't do if they are things she wants.  I'm 17, and have no idea how to make appointments. I can barely make a phone call. When I tried asking for therapy, my mom said I'd have to schedule it myself. The same things happened when I said I wanted vaccinated (she's anti-vax). She says she's ok with it when I want to do things, but she always leaves me with no help when it comes to actually making the appointments or finding out where to go.  I was only tipped off that this may not be normal when my dad asked if I wanted the covid vaccine, and then he actually took me to the drugstore to get one (they were out tho __).  I don't necessarily need solutions, I would just really appreciate if someone told me whether this is just me being needy/dependent or not."
physical,A few weeks ago I woke up to self realization.,"Im not sure if this is trigger warning.  After walking away from my first husband I ended up with a verbally abusive and domineering boyfriend. A few weeks ago I realized this was unacceptable and if I didnt want to sweep myself under the rug or die for real at 30 then I needed to save myself from dieing inside. I broke up with my long term bf who lives in my house. I cant leave because I own it, its not. In a good condition to sell. I wont leave because I own it under mortgage and i dont want to lose it. I dont want him living here anymore but Im strategically putting up with it till i can fix this house and flip it. He would leave if I asked I think. I helped him get a job and become manager and got him transportation. We moved to this state because its cola is something i could afford without his money. Ive been planning on breaking up with him for a few years i think...even if concious me didnt know it. But now that all my ducks are in a row and i can greatfully afford it on my own in the middle of nowhere.   Im not in danger. Hes just verbally abusive. And since i broke up hes been largely nicer. But Im not fallin for that shit anymore.   Ive been decoration my 3rd bedroom so i can live in there till hes been at his job long enough to transfer home or move out into an apartment.   I need to share this with someone to get it off my chest...a d i do have a good support network of friends. Thankfully but this is just too heavy to lay on them.  I'm so sad...this year has been great for me...for self growth and realizations...but it also made me realize that I am so used to being treated like crap that I accepted that in my first marraige till i left him, and then in my 2nd happenstance relationship. It took new friends being nice to me..just nice...like just treating me with the human decency I give others...and just wanting to know me for me...no other motives. And one of my oldest friends to tell me she needed help for the very same reason. And when I offered to help her I realized, mine, I woke up and became hyper aware. I was to busy throwing myself away for these past few years i didnt stop to realize. It wasnt healthy. Period. It took my ride er die friend in physical spousal danger which is way worse the verbally demeaning and gas-lighty for that to make me realize that for me to realize as a child of domestic abuse I had grown to an adult who regaurdless of how kind i was, I accepted it in my home with my first husband in every way imaginable and unimaginable, and then to realize that I've been walking on eggshells for five years around an at first friend of 7 yrs and boyfriend for five of those that he is an adamant man whos nature is ambient verbal abuse and ad long as hes happy hes nice... like idk if he realizes hes this way...And I'm not accepting it anymore. No matter how much i love him..it took my best friend and battle buddy to make me realize its not acceptable. She did it so eloquently...slowly over the past couple years dropping hints to wake me up from my stuppor. She didnt pity me or look upon me with judgement or disgust. She simply loved me unconditionly and patiently prayed id wake up.  And that worked. I dont fucking want verbal or any abuse now or ever. It took a pandemic for me to slow down and realize I had givin up on myself and just fell into survival, and that while Id been helping others live I was barely surviving. Shamefully in secret. That all my family and friends saw and i didnt realize even when they knew. My spirit was crushed I thought I was crazy, the minute I broke up with him I didnt feel like vomiting that next morning.  For me as long as I woke up the next morning and wasnt physically harmed like my marraige or childhood I was fine. It took me quietly asking for years for human decency before I realized I am not good at picking partners. So for a while I wont have one, so I can continue healing myself and rebuilding my standards. High standards standards so high that will seem immpossible to anyone but the right person. Ive got a big heart and I accepted trash. Because I'm used to it. I am so happy, so elated the world stopped so I could save myself. If you have kids raise them right, if you are in a domestic abuse relationship I can direct you to all the different help sites and resources I thought I didnt need but would so willingly offer to others who finally broke free....until 2 or 3 weeks ago when i broke free...i havent stress thrown up in a week. This is big. This is good. And am sorry if this triggers anyone."
physical,"I don't know how to leave and my ""friend"" bailed on me. Please help","I'm really struggling right now and I need some support. I don't know what to do.  I (24F) have been with my partner (25M) for nearly 5 years and it was really good at first, we even bought a house together. But last year he started getting more stressed at work (he's doing a PhD) and has been getting increasingly more physical with me when he's upset. It started fairly small, but now he's punched dents into my car, and will pick me up and throw me when he gets angry (he's a foot taller than me and I weight about 48kg). I've tried to leave, but he tells me that if I do he'll kill himself, that I'll come home to a dead body and it will be all my fault. So I agree to stay,he says he'll get help, but he won't and will make excuses, e.g. the referral line is too long, therapy is too expensive, he can't afford time off work etc.  I managed to get the courage to leave on Monday. I booked a crap hotel room for a few nights, went to work like normal and went there after. Then I called and told him. I couldn't afford to stay there for long (the mortgage and bills are in my name because I'm the one that works), and I don't have any friends close by (we moved for his work), so I called the one person I thought was my friend and told her everything. She told me I was ""so brave"" and told me to come stay with her for at least the weekend so we could try and sort things out.   Today I checked out of the hotel and started to drive to her(she lives about a 3 hour drive away) but she texted me that ""something came up "" and she ""was busy"" and couldn't take me in. I'm heartbroken. She was part of my escape plan. I have no friends or family, and I can't afford anywhere else. So I had to go back to him. He apologised and said he's getting help,but I don't believe him anymore. I just opened Facebook and her boyfriend just posted pictures of them and her other friends at the pub. She knew everything, promised to help me, and she ditched me to go to the pub with her boyfriend.   I don't know what to do. I've got nowhere to go. He's being nice now but I don't know how long for. I tried calling Samaritans, but they just told me ""she's getting on with her life and you need to get on with yours "". The domestic violence helpline had me on hold for 30 minutes before I gave up.  Please help me, I'm so lost"
emotional,(F 17) I contacted a doctor and they contacted child protective services. Please help me.,I'm so scared. All I wanted was for the doctor to help me figure out whats going on with my mental health. I told them that I thought it was trauma related and I may have been emotionally abused or neglected but it's not that serious. I'm not in danger. I don't need protecting. I'm literally just highly sensitive! But now I'm really stuck. Please help. I don't want this to blow up my family. Please If you have any advice or support...
emotional,Having a rough week threatening behaviour from my brother (28M) towards myself (31F). Can this be changed?,"I'm the only girl and eldest child of three - I have 2 younger brothers. Growing up my father has been verbally and physically abusive towards my mother, verbal is on an almost daily basis - he is always assassinating her character. They are still together. My parents live elsewhere I live with my brothers, the one immediately after a couple of times a month as he's in and out with his wife, the youngest full time.  My brothers have very little regard for me. The one that comes right after me used to be more sympathetic towards me, but since he got married I've noticed scenarios where he's been purposefully selfish towards me in a targeted manner.  The youngest by about 3 years is very openly disrespectful towards me. I pay the mortgage on the house we grew up in and live in (my parents live elsewhere), do all the household shopping, and cover the bill for groceries. I do all the cooking. Every weekend I wake up and do a full English breakfast for everyone. All for a lot of disrespect in return.  &amp;#x200B;  The straw that broke the camel's back.   Saturday morning  I woke up to start the breakfast and decided to simultaneously do a bolognese dish. I saw the youngest in the hallway and told him I was going to do the breakfast and if he could come to the kitchen in 10 minutes I wanted to show him how I did the bolognese so he'd be able to do it in the future. Well, I got to the kitchen got the beef out and all the herbs, spices, and tomatoes. All I really wanted to show him was frying off the beef before pouring tomatoes in to slow cook as there was food poisoning in our house from poorly cooked bolognese. Well, 10 minutes came and went. I called him, he said he was coming. 2 minutes later I went to the living room and he's got the PlayStation on. I said ok you're playing PlayStation I was waiting on you. He started getting exasperated saying I'm not patient and he just woke up and he's been working all week and he just wants a break. And I said fine but when you change your mind you have to let me know I'm standing like an idiot waiting for you. He continued with his narrative and I insisted, I literally spoke to you 15 minutes ago that this was my plan and if you could pass by for 5 minutes I would show you xyz and you agreed. I came out of my world with the understanding that I need to explain my agenda and invite you in before you get why I'm calling you into the kitchen. You said yes, came downstairs, changed everything in your mind, and expect me to somehow be up to speed and not understand your anger at why I'm calling you? I told him I'm proud of myself for not giving in and following on the ridiculous trail he started. I turned the frying pan off and put the breakfast things back in the fridge. He's always taking me for granted. I spent the rest of the day in my room.  &amp;#x200B;  Sunday  I came down to him sweeping the kitchen (which he does like once a month.

I went downstairs and my brother just lost it saying he has a call and earphones are dead. I said we could share and it was a rare occurrence and in this covid climate people understand if there's background noise from time to time - these unexpected things happen. I had headphones so it would only be my responses that would make noise but he said his airpods were dead. I showed him wired ones that he could use but he kept flying off the handle and stalking around for about 7 minutes saying he wanted more discreet looking ones - I joined the meeting late as I wanted him to settle so everything would be calm and my colleagues wouldn't hear anything. He was giving me such looks of contempt. I told him at that point that he's displaying abusive behaviour towards me and I'm not standing for it. He went onto the call with his colleagues, he had such a sycophantic smile for them which was just jarring to be around considering how horrible he was to me 30 seconds earlier. I left back up to my room.  &amp;#x200B;  Wednesday   I cooked stir fry and told him it was ready. He said thanks and ate some.

emotional,Coming to terms with my mom's emotional abuse,"I'm visiting my parents for two weeks, and I think I'm starting to realize I was emotionally abused by my mom. My mom started suspecting I was a lesbian at the end of my last visit. I thought I convinced her I wasn't (she's very homophobic), but the second I came back home she was asking me questions about it and she basically knows, although we haven't talked about it. Now I feel like I am walking on eggshells all the time, I feel extremely anxious, she's giving me the silent treatment and I'm just waiting for her to explode. I realized that I used to feel like this all the time when I was little for all sorts of things. When I cut my hair. When she would fight with my dad. When I wanted to ask to go to a friend's house. When I didn't want to finish my food. And whenever she would give me the silent treatment or have her mood swings or whatever, she would never apologize, she'd just start acting like everything was normal and I'd be relieved but also anxious because I knew it would happen again and I had no idea what would set her off because it was so random. I know she invaded my privacy and checked my phone, I know I had friends over like twice in my whole childhood because my mom was always like lurking and eavesdropping, and I know she has dismissed my feelings (when I was diagnosed with anxiety in high school she thought I was being stupid and weak). She yelled at me called me a slut when I wore a slightly lower cut top to school once, and over a college break she saw one of my dresses and told me I'd get r\*ped if I continued dressing the way I do. I remember her yelling at me before school (about god knows what) and I'd beg my dad to not let her take me to school because I was so terrified she would hurt me or something. I have a memory of her not letting me eat. I don't know if that happened multiple times or not.  Also, she's always seen me as a vehicle to make her look good and not as like a person with feelings and a personality. She's never given a fuck about my interests, what makes me happy, and only cares about things I do when they are in line with what she wants for me. She did not bond with me at all when I was a child, my dad was the one who played with me, who talked with me about feelings and all the confusing adolescent stuff; basically my mom put zero effort into ever getting to know me, and then she'd yell at me for being close to my dad and guilt me for not being closer to her despite the fact that most of our interactions have been extremely shallow or her complaining about something about me or yelling at me or just the scary silence. Yesterday, I developed the irrational thought that she's going to kill me. My rational brain says she would never, but I know she's harmed me because I wouldn't have these thoughts and be so scared of her like this if she hadn't. I'm still confused about whether I was actually emotionally abused or if I'm just amplifying instances that don't reflect the entirety of my childhood. This is my first ever like articulation of this potential emotional abuse and I should technically be working right now, so I apologize if it doesn't really make sense! Thank you for reading :)"
emotional,Is this some kind of manipulation or am I just in a mood?,"I'm waiting to start work and running low on money so I've decided to quit smoking cigarettes. I have one pack left and I've decided once it's gone I'm going to quit. My mom has been providing for me and I'm trying to make it to where she only has to provide necessities for now.   She asked if I had money and said that if I needed cigarettes to just let her know. I told her that I'm quitting after this pack and she said ""well, I'm not going to tell you no."" And it pissed me off. I snapped back with ""Well yeah, it's my decision anyway."" Of course she has no place to tell me no with something like that. I don't understand why she would say that.  I was also drinking a little because I've been dealing with a separation and divorce. I wasnt drinking very much but I decided I wanted to stop drinking also. She is a heavy drinker, which is an entirely different issue I'm trying to deal with. But she seems to not like that I dont want to drink. She keeps trying to offer me beer and stuff. And that on top of what she said about the cigarettes makes me feel weird about it.   Sometimes she seems jealous of me. I've been working out a lot and trying to get healthy for mental health reasons with everything going on. She tries to make me eat all of the time. She sounds disappointed when I tell her I'm not hungry and she is trying o make me eat. It's like she doesnt want me to do these things for myself. I'm at a healthy weight and I feel really good. I eat healthy but she wants me to eat more than I'm comfortable with.  Most of the time she just sits around and talks about really negative stuff. When she gets too drunk she will talk about the same things over and over again. Shit that pisses her off and it's like she is just trying to escalate her anger about it. She eventually gets to a point where she is just yelling about something that she had been talking about for hours. I'm trying to get away from this mindset. I've been in a really bad place for a lot of years with depression, paranoia and delusions. I dont want to be that person anymore and she is really hard to be around.  I think she knows this and she doesnt like that I am trying to better myself. She has enmeshed herself with me before and it's like she wants me to be the same angry victimized mess that she is. I dont want to be and I'm trying my best to keep these boundaries with her.  But I guess I doubt myself a lot when I feel like I'm being manipulated.   Honestly, my entire life I have let people control the shit out of me. Between my parents and my exes I have never felt like my own person. I'm trying really hard to do that for myself now. They have always used a lot of guilt to keep me from doing things that would separate myself from them. I've felt trapped or imprisoned my entire life. How do I not fall back into that position again? I will be starting a job making really really good money. I cant wait for that because then I will have more control over my life. But it's hard to deal with the emotional blackmail that these particular people in my life have always used to keep me whoever they want me to be. Always such volatile people when they dont get what they want and I just cant deal with that drama anymore."
emotional,I don't know what's going on.,"I'm writing this because I need help figuring out what is going on with my mom. what she does hurts me emotionally but don't know if I'm thinking about this the right way. the situation is this: she starts yelling whenever she's home about something, maybe because I put a jar on the table or something. she picks on any random situation and she severely insults me, calls me names, sometimes makes me cry (but that's my fault because I react that way.), she yells about how useless I am, she gaslights me tries to make me feel bad. sometimes, in these situations, I begin to tremble and she laughs it off calls me dumb and everything ends with me locking in the room or going outside for a walk. I feel bad about the fact that I yell back, but I m just trying to understand why she does this. I'm a college student and can't move out right now. after some time she just forgets about these things and tries to be nice. I don't understand what is going on. I'm hurt but she keeps giving these mixed signals. also, there are situations when I do something positive and she tries really hard that nobody knows about it. I've noticed that. which is weird. can this be NPD or BPD? I've told her to go to a therapist and she won't go even though it's covered by insurance. I don't know why she doesn't want to come. but I do need to go because lately, I've been crying without a reason. I cried on the street a while ago while she was also there and the only thing she could tell me was that I'm pitying myself. yes, maybe I am, I don't know but what I know is that her behaviour hurts. if you can give me some idea of what might be going on please give some advice, thank you."
physical,Will anyone listen to me? I just need some support.,"In 2017; I moved in with my ex boyfriend __ai_. I was really inlove with him and I didn__ know his hometown  from a grain of salt but I moved anyway because at first he was the knight in shining armour, he was living in another major city and I was in a small town some way up North- he flew up to see me and surprise me. He was kind, charming, and a real gentleman and really made me feel like I was someone important.   Whilst we were doing long distance before moving to his hometown his ex girlfriend would message me and warn me that he was physically abusive to her throughout their relationship but he had my convinced that she was lying because there was no evidence or police report, plus he was this gentle guy he couldn__ hurt anyone right?  Eventually we moved to his HT and for the first week everything was fine. I met his friends and I started to look for work because he was on the dole and supporting us, so I wanted to take the pressure off of him. Except the problem is within the first week he became domestically violent.  It started with me not hearing him trying to move something behind me so as a consequence he slammed me into a door , tore my shirt and held me against the wall by my throat. He immediately apologised and told me that __hat wasn__ him_ and that he was better than that, he cried and begged for forgiveness and I stupidly gave him the benefit of the doubt because my mother is abusive and I didn__ want to go back to her .  Over the course of the next year Kai abused me in every possible way. From black eyes, to bruised ribs, he would kick and punch me despite me having to go work 40 hour weeks. This abuse ranges all the way to financial abuse and emotional abuse.   One time, I came late from work as he was waiting to pick me up, he was so infuriated he repeatedly punched me in the head and in the face. However as conveniently enough life enjoys fucking me ofer and a woman in a car only saw me protect myself in self defence and not the punches to the head he was inflicting on me and she reported ME to the police for DV against him.   It came to a point 2 days before his 21st birthday and that I decided that enough was enough. I couldn__ take having my savings cards held hostage , my body being beaten and I left him for good.   I decided to go to the police station and I was fucking destroyed when they told me that despite having photographic evidence that because nobody else witnessed it and I didn__ report it at the time they couldn__ do anything. Which made me feel like the past year of my life was worthless.  In January 2019 (2 months after we broke up) we started seeing us other as FWB; he was still the only person I knew in his hometown and I was so desperate to not be alone (due to prior abandonment issues) that to keep him by my side he made me admit to being the one who did all the violence and I went along with it because I wanted to keep him around so badly despite him still abusing me during the FWB period; my therapist has since told me this was a case of Stockholm syndrome and abandonment issues.  However now he has used these screenshots to __lear his name_ and make me seem like the __razy_ one. Everytime I try to make a voice for myself these screenshots of me admitting to the abuse always arise and I get silenced.   He has a new girlfriend now and about 2 months ago she messaged me in a panic telling me that she had locked herself in the garage and she was convinced he was going to abuse her. She had confided in me that he was raising his voice to her and had attempted to scare her and so- with this in mind when she stopped replying to me I feared the worst and called a welfare check on her. Once she found out I had- she called me a psycho who was only trying to ruin his life... despite her..: coming to me...originally   I am consistently being dragged through the dirt being referred to as the stalker ex, the psycho ex and  I am sick of my experience being ignored, pushed to the side, diminished and made to seem like a lie. I still have the photographic evidence to this day but it__ useless because I__e been accused of putting it on with makeup and some days it doesn__ seem like it__ worth moving ahead knowing that I__ still being shit on by those people .  Some days I don__ want to move forward knowing that my experience will forever be diminished and that he came out on top."
physical,It IS possible to suffer abuse for over 20 years.....,"In light of the recent cases involving violence against women and also against children I feel I have to let my story be told. I__ a nearly 50 years old German woman living in North Germany and as I'm worried about privacy laws and repercussions I have to declare I__ writing this to reach out, not for any personal gain.  Until lets say about 1 year ago I had suffered at the hands of my ex husband, a perverted narcissist for years, during the marriage and later. I found the courage to leave him in 2012 after 13 abusive and frightening years, where before I couldn't find a way out because of the three children I had with him. I felt the dire need to protect my 2 daughters.  **During the marriage:**  I was raped constantly, waking up in the night with him forcing himself with his weight upon me. I protested but could not cry out or move.  I was forced to do perverted degrading acts, and when I refused, he wrote me threatening letters demanding these acts and detailing why he needed these perversions (letters I still have as proof).  He had an affair for at least a year with his now present __artner_. My eldest daughter had to read on a tablet dirty talk between the both of them.  I was constantly verbally abused and degraded in front of the children and with friends in the house, in such a way so that the children would also believe the father and begin to disrespect me.  I was physically abused by being kicked by my ex in public in the playground of the secondary school where my daughters attended. (this unbelievably witnessed by another parent, a lawyer who would later work for the ex).  Had a glass of water thrown over me by him at a primary school party where the daughters attended.  Alienated by the ex from my own family.  I was forced to sign a prenuptial agreement (later degraded by the court) where I should denounce all my rights should the marriage break down.  Witnessed him playing scrabble with young daughters both under 12 using explicit sexual words.   **After the marriage:**  Facing complete alienation from my daughters who were after the separation in a one week with father one week mother living model. Parental alienation is something that seems to go unnoticed in Germany and I suffered the worst case of it.  Facing abuse from my teenage daughters because the court decided that the 3 year old son should not face the same living model as much older sisters and so live with me. The ex blamed me for the court decision and communicated this to the daughters.  Hearing from the then 9 year old son that the oldest daughter who by now lived with the ex and was 19 had been kissing my son with her tongue in his mouth.  Hearing that the then 10 years old son always had to go in the bath with my ex and then playing __aked games_ always just before returning to me after visiting weekends.  Hearing from my son that the father twisted the nipples of my teenage daughters as punishment in some kind of game. My son re-enacted the scene very convincingly and we reported this to the courts and the son was sent to some kind of diagnostic center. He was manipulated by the father and was told not to tell of the __aked games_ they play.  At divorce hearing, ex declares he has to pay a massive monthly mortgage for the house, then in the same year after the divorce declares the mortgage to be paid off. The guy is a practicing dentist with an income 4 times my own. I got no proceeds from this house. A total failure of the German legal system.  In 2019 as my second daughter was coming of age, I finally went to the police to report the historical rape and the bullying and the threatening letters. The police believed me and charged him. Unfortunately after over a year investigating, the prosecution service declared there was not enough evidence to bring to court. I also suspect the doctor title he bought from an ex-girlfriend who did the work for the thesis is used to bully and manipulate officials and ordinary people. In Germany the Dr. title is unfortunately seen as status regardless of how it is acquired.  Till 2020 my son lived with myself and my partner. The ex had for 8 years tried over the courts without success to get full sole custody of the son. Because he failed over the court, he successfully manipulated the son just as he had the 2 daughters.   Sadly in 2020, to save the son from such torment, I had to let the ex have him completely. Of course as expected, even though I live 15kms away, I lost contact with my son, with my son believing me to be a terrible mother, just as the daughters came to believe.  People may ask here. Why did I marry such a monster?  Well it__ easy. My mother had somehow schooled me to marry into security. A dentist has security, right? Why stay for so long in an abusive and degrading marriage? The answer is actually in the text. I wanted solely to protect my young daughters and the feeling of loneliness and lack of support from the outside world as my ex had successfully alienated me from friends and family.   I__ now a recovering cancer patient and a primary school teacher. I__ happy now and have a wonderful husband and can only thank the stars that at last in 2021 I can finally close that chapter forever."
emotional,How do I grieve a trauma bond?,"In my last, long term relationship, I labeled abuse and trauma as love. I got out a month ago. And since then, I have a wide array of emotions to deal with. From indifference to anger to confusion to shame to panic to sadness. I think I am doing a good job with tackling most of these emotions, except sadness/grief.   Now that I know what I went through was extreme emotional abuse, I have a hard time dealing with my sadness. I can't understand why would I miss my abuser or why should I grieve his absence. It is so bizarre to me. Am I wrong for being so sad and broken over the fact that my abusive relationship ended?   How do I come to terms with it? How did/do you deal with these waves of grief?"
physical,Detective thinks I coached the kids to talk about sexual abuse,"In the middle of a divorce from a covert Narc. After a school official witnessed an altercation, Children services got involved.    For the first time I felt like I had the freedom to protect my kids... then, one of my kids tells me about a night I had worried about since it happened.  I reported it.  Months later after all the exams and interviews, Children Services says they were confirming the physical abuse but not the sexual, primarily because they didn__ have a third party reporter.  A few days later (last week), another child of mine tells me their father did the same thing for many years!

physical,Marriage counseling: question about abuse,"In the standard form that a therapist requires one to fill out when starting a marriage counseling: Is yelling, stonewalling, sexlessness considered emotional or mental abuse?  What if you leave it unchecked, but your partner checks it? What is the significance of these initial forms?"
emotional,My father is a very violent person,"Is my first post here and I want to understand my childhood trauma. Not sure if is the right subreddit and if you have better suggestions, please let me know. Is also a bit long.  I was supposed to meet my therapist 2 times per week and talk about my childhood trauma, but for personal reasons he could not continue our sessions anymore. It stings a bit, but it is as it is. I search now for another one.  My father was extremely controlling, manipulative, verbally and phisically violent, gaslighting and in constant anger and rage. He hit us and my mom so many times. When he hold some of his rage against my sister and I, he would lash out on mom. Once punched her nose while we were eating together with him. Another time took her head in his arms and threw her into a wall. Slapping, hitting , hair pulling were on a daily basis almost. We lived in constant fear until we moved out for studies.  His level of control was incredible. I had to report almost everything in my life. He decided where I have to study. He even decided when is time to lose my virginity by hiring a sex worker for me. That affected me a lot and I thought I had erectile dysfunction because of this for long time. He is also very religious, homophobic and xenophobic.   I was lucky with having my mom and my sister. We were very close and he tried to even break that connection between us and divide us. I remember he would repeat that mom is stupid and uneducated until we all started to internalise that. When I was about the age of 14 I started to realise his abuse and gradually started my decoupling journey. I rarely see him now (I am 33) and I set very clear limits with him, but he is still very manipulative. When he fails controlling me he runs and vents to my sister. She listens to all his madness.  I encouraged mom to divorce him 10 years ago. While it broke my heart to know I fight against my own father, I felt is the right thing to do. Mom went through a horrible period. She is in constant depression. My sister as well and I am the only one to do some therapy. We try to help each other as much as we can, but there is also a lot of phisical distance between us.  Also I kind of taken the role of a ""therpist"" which affected all my romantic relationships. I have this tendency of falling in love with someone who has some childhood trauma. I relate a lot. I can't control it almost. I suffer from recurrent depressions and have also codependency traits. Also because my father was constantly angry, I think I tend to suppress anger in my attempt to reject my father's behaviour and then I become passive aggressive. This is also a learned behaviour from my mom. She was also abusive in her own way. She would mention she is about to die when we were kids, she would hug us and cry and say she is about to die. She did this more with me that with my sister. She was telling me that her reason of existence is me. I would be so scared I remain alone. I would clinge to her. My therapist said it was an unhealthy mechanism of hers to obtain some reassurance that her life is important for someone. My grandmother did the same thing to me.   Gosh, there is much more, but I need to stop. It feels good to write about this in a way."

emotional,Is the second month of no contact the hardest?,"It has been over a month since I went no contact with my emotionally abusive ex-gf. Over the past month, more and more of her behavior is ""clicking"" in my brain and making me realize just how manipulative, controlling, indifferent, and plain cruel she was throughout our relationship.  Despite this, I continue to have deep sorrow and waves of anger about the whole situation. All I want is to be able to tell her how much she has hurt me in the hopes that she won't do it to another person in her life. I suppose this post is in hopes that you can all encourage me to keep up no contact and that this will get better."
physical,Abusive boyfriend,"It is __ I__ really going through it right now and may need to get legal representation , I__e been put in a really bad situation , and without his cooperation , of giving me back what is mine , I__l have a real fight ahead of me either way _ I__ starting to write everything on sheets of white paper gone thru about ten filling up , some of the highlights holding my hostage in my car before work unless I gave him my cell phone , I was late, insult to injury_ went into my tablet that was linked to my accounts changed my passwords , and the account settings so that I couldn__ access them , took pictures that he stole off my phone sent them to  himself , showed people ( I was naked and they weren__ for him nor did I know they were on there from like years ago )we live on the water , threw that tablet in the ocean , obviously never replaced it , another promise along with the last three months I__e been paying our entire rent and every luxury like toilet paper and deodorant, never going with our anything   He__ in my opinion , a deep adderal psychosis , has visual and auditory hallucinations , what has come along with that is multiple personalities , one of them is the one that convinced me to stay and the other shines a flashlight in my eyes at night until morning talking to themselves tearing our house apart , speaking just loud enough hours straight so that , with headphones in at the loudest volume I can still hear him   He has separated parents , one of which just bought a house with 4 extra bedrooms , and the mother owns property that she__ let him like in rent free , the problem now is he flips the script , just today it__ changed a few times and he now wants the apartment since it was his originally , and his dad co-signed , yet I__e been paying the past few months myself   This is just a portion of the pages I__e written but I__e been the only one working , when I would be out he__ harass me to no end , so I stopped even bothering besides work and driving my epileptic mother around , so I__e been funding my very own personalized hell and now have no money , and he__ made promises of months to pay me , I__e met his mother and father , the father will take care of me i know that but I feel he owes me more than just the rent I paid for us , for all that I__e been thru and I thought I was __nvesting_ that money.   but that__ not even everything , it floods my brain now that I deal with it but I can__ put enough emphasis on the conditioning , love-bombing, gaslighting and absolute torture and harassment , I can__ make sense of it and what to do  So I guess my question is how do I go about proving that he tortured me . I have friends who saved voicemails and texts of me crying expressing at those moments where I was and actually told someone . He__ threaten me in every which way so that I didn__ tell people it was happening . I__ very scared."
emotional,why cant i let go ?,"it__ been 7 months since my ex left me in such a heartless manner, but yet i__ still stuck in him. i still replay the good memories we had, the day we first started talking, how nervous i was when we kissed in central park, how he would wake me up to food and kisses, how hard we laugh that he would have to get his inhaler. stuff like that replays over and over at this point i feel like my mind is toying with me. it went from perfect to okay to bad real fast. we moved pretty fast, met in Oct, made it official on nov,11 the he had me meet __is friends and family_ then i was staying at his house for weeks on.  i grew extremely attached to him i barely was back home with my family since my family is toxic and draining it was my escapism. he was my escape from my shitty life. he also was a party guy, aspiring musician, heavy drug user and i got caught up in it badly. we would go on hard drug benders that would fuck me so mentally.   he knew a lot about me that i regret telling him so soon cause later on he started to use it against me. i struggle with my mental health really bad i suffer from clinical depression, anxiety and ptsd. i was no walk in the park i can tell you that. fast forwards few months in i found out a lot of questionable stuff he has done with other girls. some girl accused him of cheating on me at a party, he was texting girls he__ fucked and liked, compared me to his exs subtly, still followed his ex until i brought it up, liked sexual pics of them and commenting on it too.   there were times where i didn__ feel like he truly loved me cause of the past shit. any issue i had with him he would get extremely angry with me, yell at me then proceed to tell me to leave and how shitty of a person he is. tell me how insecure, crazy i was being and that he__ going to leave me. every argument we had he would break up with me and every time i would beg him crying not to leave me. he would be so cold whenever i would breakdown and cry he would either leave and leave me alone or just ignore me completely.  i tried to understand his pov but i was hurting so bad cause i loved him so much and i didn__ feel like he felt the same way. it was things like that fucked me up so bad cause i don__ understand. we had such beautiful moments where i felt so love coming from us and i know he felt it too so why did he have treat me like im so disposable? im still depressed and stuck while he__ moving on and it hurts so much."
physical,My dad beat me up in front of my kids and when I called the police they took me to jail.,"It__ been a rough week or so. My dad and step mom came to my house a few days before Christmas, unannounced. Me and my dad got into a disagreement and my step mom(who is aware of his abusive behavior) step in the middle to avoid conflict.   The second she stepped in the middle my dad hit me and began hitting me repeatedly all while being held down by my step mom and her screaming __on__ do this_(she was saying this to me btw). I took the kids and went into my room and stood to put pressure on the door. My sons were screaming crying all while I was trying to call the police. Passing out right before they got there.   When I came to, the police barely asked me anything. After all they had to get through my entire apartment to get to me. Paramedics rushing in(it was a lot).   The police handcuffed me the second I got into the ambulance because my step mom lied for my dad and said I started it.   I have never been to jail before let alone walking in there with a beat up face, eye swollen shut, and a pulsating migraine. My dad lives so close to me that because he does I can__ even go near my home. I missed Christmas with my kids, and will miss New Years. I__e been in a hotel for a week but my time(financially) is coming to and end.   This was the saddest Christmas I__e ever had and after years of being my exes punching bag the fact that the one person I really had did this to me and my children(my oldest is traumatized).   So here I wait in a hotel, alone. Hopefully I can regain my sight but I__e already had several panic attacks.   I just don__ understand how I called the police looking for help and they didn__ help me or make my home environment safer.   I couldn__ spend Christmas with my kids and that__ what breaks my heart."
physical,Frustrated a year later_.,"It__ been a year since he last hurt me, and we__e been separated and living apart since Feb 2021. I wasn__ able to financially leave before that, and he ended up leaving me for another woman- probably because I refused to have kids with him and couldn__ stand him touching me besides a hug or simple kiss for the past 3 years. It__ been really hard on me financially and getting a divorce has been dragged out, separating bills and still having to be civil towards him makes me feel like I__ still under his control. Some people around me are pushing me to pursue spousal maintenance but I don__ want to deal with him any longer than necessary. It__ also been a struggle trying to heal from the memories of things that happened. I started dating my boyfriend back in June and he__ been great to me and we__e taking things slow. He was over last weekend, we were joking around loudly talking over each other while watching a movie. There was a lull in the conversation, I got sucked back in to the movie, and my boyfriend suddenly continued it. I instinctively whipped my head around to look at him and froze in fear. He recognized what was happening, held me close and kept apologizing. He__ a sweetheart, he__ never hurt me and I__ genuinely not afraid of him_ But I__ frustrated that I had a reaction when it hasn__ happened since my ex last laid his hands on me. I don__ want to be labeled a victim or a survivor, I just want to move on and be myself and be happy_."
emotional,How to let go and move on?,"It__ been just over a year since I walked away, but I can__ seem to find peace/closure. Does anything really help with this, or does it just take more time?"

physical,Still in love with my ex yet falling in love with someone else.,"It__ been months since everything. I moved apartments so he can__ find me and I don__ have to think about the space I shared with him. I__ in weekly therapy, took time off work to do a daily program for two months and have already been back to work full time.   I already started seeing someone for awhile now. He__ someone I dated just briefly 6 years ago before I had to move. Now he got a job close by and we have been seeing each other exclusively. His daughter just came back into my life too and I have her to think about. He and I always remained close friends throughout the years. We just lived in different places until now. He__ someone I have tremendous respect for. We like to say he__ my biggest support and I__ his biggest fan.   He__ been there for me through this entire process. He knows every detail on all sides of everything. He__ my anchor and keeps me grounded.   I__ falling deeply in love with him.   But I find myself still missing my ex. A lot. My ex is not in my life in any way. I even stopped checking his sm weeks maybe over a month ago now I don__ know. Last I saw he was dating and that__ cool. Whatever. Maybe he will grow himself more for this person. With how horrible things turned out, there__ no way we could ever be together again. Plus I value and respect myself enough to not let him back or especially let him know where I live or the life I__e been building because it__ so good.   Blessings have just poured down in my life in every way and I__ beyond grateful. I can__ mess it up. I won__ jeopardize everything.   He didn__ end up being anyone special. He ended up being someone who beat me and dating within a day or two after he was arrested. There__ no honor or respect in any part of that.   I__ just venting because. If I don__ stay busy. If I__ not moving. Those tiny little moments of downtime, in the quiet moments, I think of him &amp; I still get sad.   I try to acknowledge it and let the wave pass.   But sometimes it still hurts. I don__ question why it hurts. No matter what he did to me or what happened between us, we had this whole life together and I loved this man. Of course it__ going to hurt. Of course it doesn__ just go away. After all the grieving is done. The hate goes away. The resentment goes away. All those strong emotions go away.   &amp; you just still have those moments of weakness where your mind wanders. About the future that never happened. About the best friend you were constantly laughing with. &amp; it hurts.   But then you fact check and remember that__ not the future you would have actually wanted and you weren__ always laughing. You were usually anxious and miserable. Which was it more?  I__e never been in love with two people at once before. It doesn__ mean I love this new person any less. It__ just only one person is an option. So I build something healthy with the person that has potential.   What I__ getting at is even if you__e doing all the right things, there__ so much to say about trauma bonds. The only thing that heals it is continuing no contact and time. Making healthy choices. Respecting yourself. Letting more and more time pass. It has mostly dinishished into nothing. But right now I just needed a safe space to write because my heart hurts."
emotional,That he__ happily moved on seems so unfair,"It__ been nearly 5 months since I was able to walk away after seven years of gaslighting, lies, and manipulation. He destroyed my soul. I don__ even know who I am anymore.   I went three months NC and thought everything was going to be ok. It seemed easier than I expected. I felt so free.  Then we crossed paths.  He was friendly, like nothing had happened and we were the best of friends.  And just like that, I was back at square one.  Thinking about him constantly, wondering if he was seeing anyone. Hoping to run into him again.  Seeing him undid everything.   And THEN, I saw the online posts of him with his new gf - selfies of them embracing, with flowers he__ given her, traveling the country together, happily in love.   Everything I__ ever wanted from him in all those years we were together, but which he withheld.   I__ alone, struggling, anxious, depressed, soulless, uninteresting, incapable of happiness - all because of him.   Yet he gets to move on and find love and happiness - everything everyone told me he was incapable of when we were together.   What was so wrong with me? Why wasn__ I worthy of those things? Why does he deserve happiness after he destroyed my life?  It__ so unfair."

physical,"my story, one year later","It__ been one year and I__ finally sharing my story. Anyone who does not care to read or support, stop here.   **trigger warning, domestic violence**  November 11, 2020 was the worst day of my life. I was in a physically and mentally abusive relationship and I already had an escape plan. I had began the paperwork for a new place the week before because I already knew it was getting worse and eventually I would not make it out with my life.   Being in the military, I decided to go get dinner with my friends for Veterans Day. While I was at dinner, he came home from work and began questioning where I was. I told him I was at dinner with my friends and even sent a picture. While at dinner I started receiving texts saying if I don__ come home at that moment he was going to kill my dog. The girls and I got in my car and I began to head to his house. While in the car, I received a phone call from him. All that could be heard was my dog screaming in pain. She is a 5 pound toy poodle. I rushed home, put the garage code in, and she ran out, limping. I still don__ know what he did to my dog that day.   I put her in the car and drove off. He followed my friends and I around town, attempting to drive us off the road in his truck. Eventually we drove to the police station where we knew we would be safe and he drove away. Later that night, I went back to get a bag so that I could stay with my friend for a few days while I get my new place situated. I get home and be begins to slap, choke, pull my hair, and drag me. This wasn__ anything new but it was different than normal. I knew he wanted to kill me that night. I was able to get away to the backyard to call the police, but he took my phone and broke it into pieces as soon as they picked up. Nobody came to help me that night.   He started making his way to the bedroom and I immediately knew to run because I knew he was going to get his gun. I ran outside to my car and I looked back and saw him pointing his gun at me. I could see the reflection of the beam in my glasses. He was pointing the gun at my head. I got in my car and sped off..I can__ truly say what his intentions were, but he made it very clear on multiple occasions that I was going to die by his hand. That night, I was left with nothing. No phone, no clothing, nothing...I left that situation with my life and I am forever grateful for that."

physical,Tired of it.,It__ just a huge cycle of me forgiving him  but he does it anyway over and over again.
physical,When does it get easier,"It's be a little over three years since I escaped.   I still struggle to bathe, to look in the mirror, to see pictures of myself.   I live in filth because I can't bring myself to connect with my body enough to clean.   I'm just permanently dissociated.   Unable to connect with my body, I feel like an alien in my own skin.   As time goes on it isn't getting better - instead I seem to drift further from my body. Not looking in the mirror for three years means that I think I still look like my 19 year old self.   This 23 year old young adult with broken glasses...where did she come from? When is she leaving."
physical,Should I be warning my exes new girlfriends that he is abusive?,"It's been 13 years since our relationship ended. He's been remarried twice since our relationship and is now in a relationship with potential wife #4.   He was abusive towards me and wife #2. While I cannot confirm that he was abusive towards wife#3, I can assume that he was for obvious reasons but also because he has been arrested 5-6 times for domestic violence. He and wife #3 are officially over but he is now with girlfriend.  He mentioned to me in a conversation about his new girlfriend that ""he is the only white guy she has dated because she watched white men beat on her mom as a child.""  I felt so sick to my stomach when he said that and I just didn't respond. I am torn because I feel obligated to say something to her but knowing females, she probably won't listen and her bringing it up to him can cause him to act out violently which I don't want.  Just in case you are wondering, we talk about once a year when he reaches out to ask about our son. We have no other contact other than that but he always makes it a point to let me know about the good things going on in his life, like his new relationship. I don't talk to his girlfriend, I've never met her, I'll likely never meet her. I just feel like garbage letting a trainwreck happen without at least trying to stop it.  So....wwyd?"
physical,My ex admitted to past strangulation yet I miss him. Advice?,"It's been a month since breakup and I swear for the past 8 months he had shown incredible growth, so much consideration, he was absolutely wonderful. The thing is that he admitted to me once that he choked his ex out of ""self-defense"". Am I better off without him like everyone says? I miss him so so very much. I truly believed that he was remorseful and would never do it again. Yet, I always had this fear of him in the back of my mind, despite him truly changing and growing. Knowing he had that side to him of rage really scared me, although I know how ashamed he gets when he's angry. In the end I basically self-sabotaged the relationship due to my overwhelm and anxiety. Truthfully, he wasn't doing anything to fuel that overwhelm. He was actually being extremely kind and supportive. He was calm and peaceful. He told me he was proud of me and that I was worth it and that I could overcome. When it became too much for him, he left with all the power and I left so powerless, I chose to stay with him despite having fears. I believed in his heart. Now he left mine shattered (I know that sounds cliche). I got too attached :(  Truthfully, he was so intelligent and considerate. He said to me he'd done ""horrible things"" in the past which I'm assuming was the past abuses but I saw true remorse. In the end, he said some truly mean things to me that left me with my self-esteem really affected because he equated me basically to a very weak person when he left me. It is wrong to be so sad and defeated that I lost him? I truly feel like I'll never find someone like him again. I know this all sounds so crazy. Just looking for someone advise to move past. It's hard because all I see is him still. :("
physical,Letting go,Its been a year and a half since my last domestic relationship but I still can't seem to get past the trauma and everything thats happen and I don't want it to get in the way of a current relationship I'm pursuing  need ways to let it go .
emotional,Rant time,"It's been about 4 years since I left my ex, and almost 1 year since I finally realised that what I experienced was emotional abuse. Since then, I've been taking therapy and working on myself. I have good days and bad days, and I've accepted that anxiety is a part of me, at least right now. For the most part, my ex and I aren't in touch. Sometimes we do text each other because we are In the process of finalising our divorce. This is why I have the occasional update from him.     He's doing great, he's well settled in his career, just had a healthy baby, has a great apartment, and is has the time and energy to focus on fitness and hobbies. He also thinks we are still on good terms (I never confronted him about the abuse because I know he doesn't see it at all, and I don't want him to create issues with the divorce process). I, on the other hand, am struggling with everything. My anxiety has caused problems at work, I'm struggling to get ahead career wise, on my bad days I have no energy to workout or practice my hobbies, I hate having anxiety - it feels like self-harm, and while my life is getting better and I'm making efforts, it's nowhere like his. I find myself falling back into patterns of thinking I'm stupid, and useless, and horrible, and have to make an active effort to snap out. It is so mentally fatiguing. I want to start a family but with my current mental state, I think I'd be a terrible parent, plus I can't really do it until I'm a little settled in my career.     This is so unfair! Where is the justice?! Why did he inflict damage and move on, I'm here dealing with the repercussions?! Sometimes I wish for something awful to happen to him, then I feel like a horrible person for even thinking such thoughts. I just want to move on, not give a shit about him, and have a great life. I tell myself I'll get there, but then I wonder if I'm just lying to myself. How do you heal and get these negative thoughts out of your mind?"
physical,Does domestic violence something that can get better over time?,"Ive (25f) have been dating my boyfriend (29m) for 8.5 years.  Ive been told that i was ""groomed"" because i was only 16 when we started dating. Long story short, he used to beat the shit out of me. One time we went to go get something and i ""took too long"" so he decked me in the face while I was driving. That. Was the first time.  Then it was punching me so hard he broke my glasses, which cut my face. He would yank me by hair across the room,  put me in legitimate chokeholds. He stalked me, got me fired from 2 jobs. At one point he drove me to the woods and said he planned to murder me. He got paranoid and used to accuse me of hiding people around the house..  he hacked every social media account i had,  drove ALL my friends away (he scares them) then i found out i was pregnant resulting from be being drugged and raped by my friends brother. My boyfriend talked shit about my son when he was born saying ""hes black!!!!"" Which, wasnt that. He got stuck in me during birth and immediately needed oxygen, he was dark purple. My boyfriend has not laid a hand on me since 2016. He gas lights me everyday and i *do* love him,  but, when does it stop? Will it ever stop?"
emotional,Excessive Response,"I've (35f) been out of my abusive intimate relationship for about 14 months. I recently (2 months ago) started dating someone new (33f). A couple of times with her and once with a friend I feel like I'm back right in the middle of a fight with my ex as far as my emotional response. The similarity about the situations are that we had plans and I had expectations and then things change or plans get cancelled. Suddenly, I'm in this sort of panicked defensive state. I feel like that fight or flight part of my brain is triggered. And well I tend to lean towards the fight because I'm never going to let someone make me feel the way my ex did again.   I feel like in all the situations I responded at an 11 and like a negative response was ok but it should have been like 4. I just feel really elevated like my heart is racing and I can't think straight. In general, I'm a super adaptable person. I'm very go with the flow, so these reactions (roughly 3 over the last six months or so) have really caught me off guard. Does anyone know what this called or how to address it?   My girlfriend and I have made a plan. I can use the words ""I'm feeling elevated"" to let her know I'm feeling I'm feeling emotionally elevated and need some time to calm down/think clearly. I think this is a good plan, but if I understood more about why I was reacting this way I think I could address it head on. It feels like a conditioned response but I don't know why."

physical,He's blackmailing me,"I've (F30)  been in a 10 year relationship with an emotional and physical abuser (M34). A few months ago, we decided a divorce was necessary so we're moving forward with that, but he's still at the house. He is unemployed since 2019 and has not tried to get work, with what money he did have, he bought a live in van and a trailer and plans to live in that for a while. He has been prepping to move for months and is excited sine this is his dream, to live in the van in the woods. We've had numerous arguments since the divorce got brought up and he keeps telling me to leave and go to my parents house an hour away. I can't do this because unlike him, I have a job. He says its abusive of me to kick him out when he's not ready yet since he doesn't know where he's going. So for months we've been living in limbo.  He say's he'll be out by the end of the month, but he said that last month too.   Tonight he got really aggressive and scary he hasn't done that since he went behind my back and told my parents we were getting a divorce and that they need to pick ME up because he was afraid of me.  On that night he had just pushed me out of the room after screaming in my face.. Anyway this morning we got into an argument and since then he had been slamming doors all day. I asked him to stop because it was not only scaring me, but the animals and he just did it louder and more frequently. I finally confronted him this evening saying that is was uncalled for and he went off on me. He said I was harassing him then proceeded to call me terrible names because I finally yelled back at him. He then starts to come at me and screams in my face that if I don't leave him alone he will share my biggest shame to my family. Something happened when I was a kid that is very shameful and he is the only person that knows about this and if my family knew I would probably kill myself. He repeated my shame over and over saying he would tell them all about me if I wasn't nice to him. The worst part is that he isn't even recalling the story correctly and is making it sound way worse than it is and now I'm terrified even more that he will tell them. I tried to tell him that he isn't even remembering it right and he called me a liar. As he's calling me names and threatening I'm backing up into my room I yell at him to stop and he barges toward me screaming in my face, I back up into my room, he stomps on my foot as he grabs the handle to door to my room and slams it over and over in my face while calling me names and calling me abusive.   His eyes go from brown to black when he's like this. His whole face distorts and it's like he's a shadow of the man I knew moments before. It's a surreal experience. I see him, yet he's someone else. Someone who absolutely hates me with every fiber of his being.   It's been months since I've self harmed, I started doing it during this relationship. I was doing really well this year since I'm in therapy. When we decided on the divorce, I was trying not to interact with him much, I held my tongue as to not anger him so he that we wouldn't argue. I keep telling myself, he'll be gone soon and I got through it. But I hurt myself tonight. It's nothing serious, I just feel stupid. He brought  up the shame and it's all coming back in waves. I had a panic attack, then shook uncontrollably for a few minutes. Thankfully my dog was there to comfort me. I accidentally trained him to be my emotional support animal. I feel pathetic. How could I have let this happen again? I would have episodes like this after major arguments. The hold he had on me was... intense. I felt like I would kill myself if I couldn't  be perfect for him. He always said he never had expectations of me, but also said I was never doing/being enough.. sometimes I was too much.. occasionally I was just the right enough, then I'd screw it up by being myself.   I can't wait till he's gone. I can't wait till I'm home alone. I can't wait to feel free in my own home. I can't wait to not be threatened and shamed. I can't wait to not be startled by slamming doors and screaming men. I can't fucking wait."
emotional,how do i (18F) get away from my abusive mother (40F),"I've always lived with my mother exclusively. I don't consider myself to have a father, I am also an only child.  I am no longer a student and looking for a job, however Covid has made job hunting especially difficult these past couple of years, especially in my field (Animal work).My relationship with my mother has been quite difficult ever since I got into my teenage years, and I've always been told the strain on our relationship was exclusively_my fault and a result of my own issues and taking my problems out on my mother, I've never found this to be the case.In 2017 I was diagnosed with high functioning Aspergers, obviously, with this condition when I let people know they generally will make reasonable adjustments for me when needed (such as giving me more detailed instructions, checking with me to make sure I didn't intend on coming off a certain way, making plans in advance instead of surprising me spontaneously, etc), my mother, however, refuses to accommodate for me at all, even though she was the one who took me to get diagnosed in the first place. It feels like she always expects me to know things, read her mind, always extend a hand to help even though I'm not that kind of person (though I have told her on multiple occasions that in most situations I would help if only she would ask. She usually expects me to just read the room and offer when she needs help, I don't usually offer because I don't notice she needs help with something or I'm just not interested in helping). She also expects me to be observant of my surroundings and gets angry if im not. My mother has no diagnoses_of her own that I am aware of.We have lots of verbal fights. My mother insults me and berates me and I'm not the kind of person who will just stand there and take it, so I do the same in return if she gets verbally aggressive with me. I will often get upset after these fights and attempt to approach my mother to talk about them. She always refuses, I've tried minutes later, hours later, days later, weeks later.. if I try to talk to her about a fight that happened, it usually results in another fight. My mother likes to sweep problems under the rug and pretend they never happened. Repeat cycle.  Last night, I went out into the kitchen to make myself something quick to eat in the oven as I was hungry. My mother was putting up blinds in the kitchen and was standing on the kitchen counter to do so. She had no issue with me doing this as I wasn't in her way until I told her I was going to leave and come back quickly as I needed to set a timer for the food. During the time I left and came back, she stepped on the fork I was using and immediately became infuriated. She insulted me, calling me a ""selfish cow"" for coming out into the kitchen and making food and not waiting for her to finish first (she didn't ask). I insulted her in return and it became another back and forth fight, only this time, she got even angrier and came down from what she was doing to physically attack me. I fought back. She hit me, pulled my hair, kicked me, shoved me, and told me to get out of her kitchen. I was going to call the police and wanted to, but I was terrified that if I did this and she got arrested that she would lose her job and that I would have to move into a hostel or something and never see my cat again, so I decided not to call the police. I called my aunt who was unsure of what advice to give me.  Also not to mention that my mother has convinced herself that she is the victim in the attack situation.  I am really sick and tired of all this verbal, mental, and now physical abuse that I've had to suffer with my mother. I don't have the money or a stable job to be able to move out on my own, but more than anything I want to. what am i supposed to do?  TLDR: my mother is physically and mentally abusive. i cant afford to leave. what do i do"
emotional,Is my abuse any less because it wasnt in 'real life?',i've been a victim of abuse ever since i was 14 and i'm 23 now. I've always fought really hard to defend myself and i've always been victim blamed because i've made mistakes. But it doesn't mean i deserve to be abused and i'd really just want some support for once
emotional,Am I crazy for feeling like I did nothing wrong.,"I've been getting into a lot of arguments with my boyfriend lately. I own animals, I keep fish, reptiles, and I foster cats for adoption. Yes a lot of my time goes into them as they depend on me for survival. But I still make time for my boyfriend. I go to his house after 10 hour shifts, exhausted. I'm always trying to do something even if its only for a couple hours before I go home. He tries to blame my animals for being the reason he's not getting the attention ""he deserves"". I can't spend the night since I have 3 week old kittens I bottle feed every 3 hours. I hate it. It makes me feel terrible. He never wants to come to my house because he says he hates what they've made me become (even though this is who I've always been). Please someone tell me is this abuse or not. I can go into greater detail if needed but I feel crazy for feeling like I'm not wrong in the situation."
emotional,Being Gaslit. Need Help Deciphering,"I've been in a super tumultuous emotionally abusive relationship that seems to thankfully finally be coming to an end. She was a physical abuse victim herself and seems to think that excludes her from responsibility for her emotional abuse.   Her main thing is to ""end"" the relationship whenever she's not getting her way. Over about 15 months I'd say she's ""ended"" Things 50+ times. She belittles me, calls me a fat, ugly, unattractive loser. Tells me my family doesn't love me. Tells me no one ever will an that I'll never have a successful relationship. Calls me a failure for still living at home without a serious career.   When things *really* don't go her way, she threatens to fuck other guys. Just this past Saturday night she told me she had a date and was ""going to get fucked tonight."" I woke up to messages from her about how she really likes this guy and they're going to get serious and do ""everything that comes with that"", an obvious sexual insinuation.   Yet she'll somehow take zero responsibility for this. She finds it all completely justified because after one of her emotionally abusive tirades that culminated with her ending the relationship, I went on IG and left some flirtatious comments on random IG celebrities/models pictures. This was nearly a year ago at this point. Nothing came of it and my intent was just to feel better, as she'd gone out of her way to completely crush my self esteem. I know it wasn't my finest moment and I've tried to apologize since, but to no avail.   I'm not even really sure why I'm posting this. I just need someplace to vent. I don't want to tell my friends or family. I don't want to ruin anyone else's perception of her, and the rest wouldn't even care. I've never had this experience in my life. I've never been so emotionally brutalized by someone I cared about so much and really believed cared about me.  To answer an obvious question -- when these things ""end"", she eventually calms down and we talk again like normal. I guess I'm a total sucker for sticking around. I know that. But I'm not young and *when things are normal* we're extremely compatible. I really *wanted* to start a life with this person and I guess I've been mourning what could have been for a while now. I'm just always hoping she'll either stop or take responsibility for her actions.   She tells me she's never acted like this with an ex before and she's had long-term successful relationships with guys who she's still on good terms with. And so she blames me. And I guess if that's the case -- and she still has exes who care about her, maybe it *is* me? Do abusers really just start their abuse randomly in their early 30's after years of healthy relationships?   I just wanted to put this out there. I've been self harming a lot lately and I've had to miss work because of it. I've had issues in the past with suicide but and substance abuse, but it's never been this bad.  Thanks for reading."
physical,I think I've finally had enough,I've been with my boyfriend on and off for 11 years and it's always been abusive. Last night we got into an argument when I found out he'd been buying drugs again. It ended with me going to the hospital to get staples in my head and him being carted off to jail. The worst part is the cops couldn't even find him and I was the one that had to call them back to get him when I found him sleeping in the back of his truck. A temporary restraining was granted. Idk I just feel so lost and my head really hurts and this probably sounds really rambling but I just needed to get that out. Life just really sucks right now. I know I can't get back together with him. This has to be the last time.
physical,VERY LONG POST. Is this abuse?,"I've been with my man for 15 years. Within the first few months, he had slapped me very hard a few times, the first being after I said Usher was sexy. He told me not to disrespect him like that.  At 6 months together we moved in together, and things changed a lot. I had moved 4 hours away from my family of be with him since he moved for work. I was attending college but eventually stopped. We didn't have internet so I stayed at home pretty much all day. I would clean and do my make-up and wait for him to be home.  When he was home, he would basically ignore me, or insist that I perform oral sex on him, which I didn't mind, but if I said I didn't want to, he would berate me, sometimes hurt me, definitely forced it a bunch of times.  I will say that I have a kink which is being forced, but a lot of the time, I wasn't into it and asked him to stop. He didn't. And if I cried he enjoyed it even more. If he was annoyed by my fighting sometimes he would stop and throw me to the floor, calling me useless. (This has never stopped btw, 15 years in and he still does it).  One night he came home from being at a bar with his sister (I was 18 and couldn't go). He was in a bad mood, I could tell. I tried to be nice but because he was so drunk, he wanted to have sex. He was having... difficulties...and said it was because I was overweight. I told him he could hurt me, (I'm a masochist and he's a sadist) and that helped, but he took it too far. He raped me and beat me for 4 hours. I know because I kept focusing on the digital clock on the bedside table. Bright red numbers counting the minutes of my terror. A month after that I left, but 4 months of being with a worse guy and basically being homeless, I begged him to come save me. He showed up, got me off the drugs I was addicted to, and held me through my withdrawals. I suffered a miscarriage also, I didn't even know I was pregnant. He was so caring and sweet, and had done a lot of maturing while we were broken up. We get an apartment together and it's like a fairytale. We don't fight, don't argue, we were madly in love again. We lived there for a year and it was great. Then he lost his career, we moved to a different apartment, and he started drinking heavily. We had a friend living with us and he drank with him all day and night..I'm talking they finished off entire handles each, and he started being controlling again. I had to keep the house clean and cook every meal for him and our roommate. He would punch my leg and keep digging his thumb into the bruise if I didn't do what I was supposed to do. He hated when I hung out with friends, and constantly accused me of cheating. At the time, Myspace was still a thing and he had numerous girls on there who he would go spend time with...I have since found out he was cheating. After I finally kicked out roommate out for bringing over people who would steal from us, he sobered up and his behavior stopped being so bad. He would romance me and things got better.  We got another place since we were kicked out of that place (long story) and though he was still very controlling thing calmed down again.  Now I want to say that I love this man with everything I have. He doesn't react with rage, he doesn't beat me into a corner, he doesn't do what I consider to be abuse. Not since that first year together. But, in the 15 years we've been together, he goes through stages of being aggressive towards me. He insults me, forces sex or sexual acts, and then it stops. For months at a time sometimes. It's gotten to the point where I don't know how to feel normal. It's almost like I want him to be like that because it feels like our normal...? Does that make sense?? Not to mention that it has severely affected my sexual pleasure, I can't seem to enjoy myself if he isn't being aggressive or at least demeaning me in some way. It's something he's always done, and I don't know how to ""get off"" without it. Flash forward to 2011, we moved again, again away from my family and friends, and again I try to go to school, and he gets a good job. But as before, I stop going to school and stay home all day. I clean, I cook, etc. We would rarely go out to town or anything, we were always home. He started to be a little more aggressive more often. Randomly. I didn't know what would set it off. One time I had a black eye, a very mild one, but it was there. He took me out to eat and go shopping, after making me do my makeup so it wasn't visible. While out he asked me how it felt to know people had no idea that he hurt me like that since we look so happy. I didn't know what to say but he put my hand on his crotch and he was as hard as a rock.  Later he held me down and forced himself on me while slapping me harder than before on the same side where the bruise was.  We lived out there for almost 10 years. This behavior became more frequent and more intense. My entire life became centered around him and what he liked or didn't like. My appearance, my housekeeping, everything. But again it wasn't like what I believed abuse to be. I've seen in movies or heard about it from people and it just seemed more dramatic and violent than what he would do. What he did was always cool and calm, he did it with such ease and confidence, I kept telling myself it was a game, he did it to turn himself on, because he's a sadist. We played around with bondage, role played, all the normal BDSM stuff so I just thought it was part of it.  He'd do it for a while, constantly, then as before, he would just stop. And again I felt myself needing it. I'd need him to hit me, or be mean to me. I found myself feeling anxious or uneasy if he wasn't being dominant and mean. So I would ask. And if I brought up that I felt he went too far and said maybe this was abuse and not good, he would laugh and say I asked for it....which I did.  So it was something I wanted... Here I am, almost 16 years together with him and now it's scary. Again his drinking got bad and he has been doing it more. But it's different now. Now I tell him I don't want it. I cry. I fight. I break down and he just keeps doing it. He says he doesn't care that I don't want it. I tell him I'm afraid of him and he smiles and says good. He'll get drunk and throw me to the ground if I say something he considered too sassy or bitchy. He doesn't always hit me, but he holds me down and says awful things to me. He makes me cry. He reminds me I have nowhere to go. That if I leave I would just go running back to him because I can't do anything right, (I have some issues so he's not wrong) and that no other man would ever be able to deal with my baggage and no one would want an overweight woman in her 30s. The sad thing is he's right. He uses me past against me when he wants to make me cry.  And every time he does this he gets hard. He can't help but touch himself as he's either hurting me or demeaning me and insulting me. He loves doing it.  I love him. I know I do because we've been through so much and we really are like best friends. We understand each other so well, we have been so close since the day we met. And I have my own problems. I take responsibility for him getting a taste for hurting me, because I was curious about BDSM and that stuff when we were first dating, but I never imagined he was actually abusive. Or is this abuse? I don't have bruises all over my body, I don't cower in a corner, although I have before, he doesn't beat me senseless... it just doesn't feel like the abuse we all know about from ads and movies, etc.  I don't fear for my life because he doesn't lash out like that, he hasn't escalated like I assume he should have by now,... IDK what to call this.    Honestly I'm not sure why I'm sharing this because I have no intention of leaving him, he's my world. I am happy with him. My day to day life is good, we laugh all the time. If you saw us together you'd never know that sometimes he gets rough with me or says mean things. He is normal 80% of the time.   Idk. Is this abuse?"
emotional,What is wrong with me?,"I've been with my partner 4 years, there is a large age gap between us I'm in my late 20s him in his early 50s.   I had just left a relationship and we had been talking at work, he asked me on a date and our first date was very personal about his daughter and ex wife who was abusive. After that came the love bombing, followed by ghosting me for voicing my opinion of, ""please don't leave me hanging all night if you can't come just say so."" I was accused of being overly sensitive and angry for this request. This set a dangerous president, me voicing my opinions meant I would be ghosted and belittled.   My friends were the worst to him, he would say that they didn't care and were just users same with my family. Anytime I would spend time with them resulted in an argument. As I was waiting on his plans I could never make any of my own. My friends are now pretty much none existent which is my own fault.  Many red flags came up over the years, we worked together and if he got upset he would message me on our work messenger aggressive messages and if no response would send them to my email until I responded whilst being as happy as Larry to our coworkers.  Years later we were made redundant, he had credit he had taken out and spent on us. Whenever he would offer to buy me/us things I'd say no I/we don't need it. Until I'd eventually cave. When we were made redundant I offered to help pay the debt, I would keep asking only to get nah sort it later only for later to never come and bills and life to keep piling up. Money is now all gone and now everything is my fault.  I got offered a job that I wanted to take that would help with debt and support us, was told what about the dog I'm not looking after him for the 7 days of training until you work from home. So a huge fight ensued, what about his interview and if he starts work. So I ended up declining for his potential job. Which he was then offered, so now it's I'm not supporting you and the dog. Another huge fight ensues, he threatens to leave and move in with his parents and is furious that my family can't help out more. And that I don't care and I'm pathetic and selfish and everything is not alright.  I want him to leave, but I still want him to stay. What is wrong with me?"
physical,Was my (F29) father (M66) just a strict parent or domestically violent?,"I've been wrestling with myself for the better part of the year whether to post here or not and am very nervous for doing so...I have never told anyone except my closest friends and my partner and even they don't know everything. I don't exactly know where to start or how to explain so I apologize in advance for any ramblings. I have to warn that this is a very long post. Also, English is not my native language so please excuse any mistakes.  TLDR; My father dealt out unreasonably harsh punishments and looking back on it I think it was domestic violence and I am still dealing with the effects to this day.  I am the second-oldest in a family of 5 children, all with the same mom, ""William"" (M31), ""Ben"" (M27), ""Nora"" (F26), and ""Jessica"" (F24). We are a South-East Asian family. My dad's way of discipline and keeping us in line is basically to make us fear being punished by him if we were to do something wrong. This includes getting bad marks on tests, lying, not doing homework, getting home too late, or any other things that comes across as disobeying him. He especially hated lying, which is hypocritical as he himself lies, and being a big man with a loud voice, just shouting at us was enough to make us cry. But he wouldn't just shout, he would hit us with things like thin plastic sticks when we were young to belts and broomsticks when we got older, anything hard really, mainly on the palms of our hands and our legs. I once brought back a tree branch from the playground at school that I really liked and he used that to hit me until I threw it away and told him that I lost it, so he told me to find another stick to bring back home. Once when we were still small, he used a wooden stick that was part of a wooden chair and beat Ben with it until the stick (1.5 cm thick) broke and my brother bled.  His punishments would go on for hours, late into the night, him shouting and screaming all the time, and no matter what we said or how we tried to defend ourselves, he would always need to have the upper hand. When trying to explain our point, if we turn out to be in the right, he would just say he is our dad and we have to obey him. We lived in an apartment at the time and we had two other neighbors on the same floor and I would try to open the door and scream/cry into the hallway hoping one of them would help. No one ever did. I was in a swim team at the time, and was so embarrassed about the bruises and marks on my legs. My swim coach would ask and I would always give some kind of excuse. I vividly remember a friend of my father asking me in front of him who I was more scared of, a burglar or my dad. I answered my dad.  One time, when I was around 9, I stayed out playing with my friends past my curfew, and the moment I opened the door to the apartment, my dad was right in front of me, shouting and yelling that I had disobeyed him and that he had no daughter like me. He picked up his wallet, pulled out all the money inside and threw it at my feet, telling me to get out and that that was all the money he had for me. I was hysterical, screaming and crying so hard, thinking I was going to be homeless. I don't remember what happened next, but a very recent conversation with my dad had us talking about this event. He told me that child kidnapping was rampant where we lived at the time and he was scared out of his mind that something had happened to me. He said that when I finally stopped crying, I said in a calm voice that I was sorry and that I would leave, and that was when he broke down crying and hugged me and said he was sorry too.  I feel like I have to say that I know for a fact that he loves me, loves all of us. He can be kind and loving, kissing and hugging us when we were small. We had everything we wanted and needed, within reason, of course. He knew all our friends, hosted birthday parties for us with my mom, bringing back our favorite treats, taking us to playgrounds and parks, picking us up after swim classes everyday without fail, watching cartoons and eating ice cream at night. Each and every one of my friends who met him all said the same thing, that he was so kind. But, throughout all the ""fun and happy times"", the fear of being punished was always, always there.  Me, William and Ben are still ""struggling"" somehow. My two sisters did not receive the same kind of punishments as we did because my dad had mellowed out a bit and they had us three to teach them stuff. William took 7 years to graduate a four-year bachelor's course. Ben dropped out of his Master's program because my dad forced him to enroll in the first place and he just did not like studying. I basically became a version of my dad during arguments with my partner, screaming and being violent, despite my immense hatred for that behavior (my partner called me out on it and I am working on being better). Me and my two brothers has contemplated suicide a couple times over the course of growing up. Yet I am sure my dad thinks he did a great job raising us. We don't do drugs, don't drink (religious reasons), my brothers and sisters have jobs, and I have a masters degree in a STEM field and am currently working in a foreign country.  Because me and siblings were so afraid of being punished, none of us would come and help when one of us were being hit, out of fear for being punished ourselves. As a result, now that we are all adults, we are not close at all. We have very low contact. When covid hit, no one called to check up on me. They came once to visit me but only after I invited them. In the very beginning, I tried to ask them how they were (my parents told me to as I was the most ""mature"") but I stopped as time went on. I have four siblings and its as if I have none. I don't blame them. I blame my parents.  I am almost 30 years old, and yet when my dad's name pops up on my phone, I am still afraid. He hasn't shouted like he did before for 5 years now, and still I look over my shoulder every time before doing anything, wondering if I would get in trouble. I have gotten better about my fear, but it is still there.  I know some of you may wonder about my mother and why she didn't try to help. First of all, she sometimes tried to but it didn't matter. When my dad was angry, nothing anyone says has any effect. Second of all, she wasn't a very good mother herself. She has favorites among us kids, and it showed. I am closer to my dad than my mom, if that says anything. And she contacts me even less than my siblings do. Thirdly, my parents' marriage was not really based on love. My dad had a girlfriend before her of a different religion (even though he wasn't very religious) and it did not work out but I do know she was his real love and that angers my mom. Based on stories told to me by my relatives, my mom was a horrible daughter-in-law to my paternal grandparents when they were alive so my dad grew to resent her even more, and my dad would never listen to anything my mom has to say. His violence was directed at her too, and she gave back as good as she got. They failed equally at being parents, and husband and wife. They are legally divorced now (they used me as the witness) but nothing has changed. If anyone would like more information about this, I will add in later."
emotional,I think my mother is emotionally abusive and I don't know what to do about it,"I've dealt with a lot of stuff from her. She's threatened suicide, she's kicked me out of the house at 17 for not giving her my prescription medication, she's threatened to get me sent to prison multiple times, and so much more.  I had moved out this year and did my best to be an independent adult. Everything went decently well up until last month when I had to stay at my mother's house for a couple days to take care of some healthcare appointments.  I had a seizure due to substance withdrawals within 15 minutes of getting in her car and the next thing I know I'm in the emergency room, about to be sent to a psych ward.  While I was in the psych ward she visited me one day and tried to explain how my seizure was actually caused by military weapons, not withdrawals, because she saw a military-style Hummer behind her car while I was having the seizure.   I'm only saying that part to illustrate how delusional she can be sometimes.   I got a plane ticket last night and I'm now on the way back home. MY home.  Of course as soon as she figured out I wasn't in the house, she begins to try to get in contact with me. I don't need to share all of it, but this one part is something that really disturbs me:  **Mother: ""I don't know where your head is at but I pray to God you come back to reality. I'd rather you be safe in jail than what you're doing. It's shameful.""**  **Me: """"Safe in jail"" is an oxymoron. Trans people get raped pretty quick in prison""**  **Mother: ""Raped is better than dead""**   This isn't the first time she said she'd prefer if I was in prison. She's said it several times this year alone.   What is even going on? How can someone, especially a mother, say something like this to their child and still pretend they love them? What should I do at this point? Is it time for me to consider some sort of restraining order? I'm scared as hell, I have no idea what she might do and I don't want to have to actively hide away from someone like this.  Is this emotional abuse? I don't even know. This entire situation just scares the hell out of me."

She's said it several times this year alone.   What is even going on? How can someone, especially a mother, say something like this to their child and still pretend they love them? What should I do at this point? Is it time for me to consider some sort of restraining order? I'm scared as hell, I have no idea what she might do and I don't want to have to actively hide away from someone like this.  Is this emotional abuse? I don't even know. This entire situation just scares the hell out of me."
emotional,I was gaslighted by the last person I expected it from and honestly it kinda broke my brain.,"I've dealt with a narcissist before and that fragmented my personality but I recovered and once I realized I was dealing with a narcissist I cut that cord immediately and never looked back.  The situation now, this person isn't a narcissist but has a few narcissistic traits and ways of behaving at times (and its due to their own trauma which they are aware of but don't necessarily work through and I only noticed these tendencies after the fact). Anyways the day I realized this person was gaslighting me (I don't think it was intentional I think they genuinely believe their own bs) it just broke my brain. They were the LAST person I thought would do that with me especially because this is also someone who has experienced narcissistic abuse and gaslighting themselves and honestly out of everything that has happened in my life, this is the thing that's making me question my sanity and whether I can really trust myself to trust others.   I don't think I can. My radar is way off. I've gotten to the point where I don't feel like I can trust myself because the opposite always holds true. If I don't follow my intuition, it turns out I should have followed it and if I did follow it it turns out I shouldn't have. Up is down and down is up. My brain is flipped and I don't know how to get it back. I'm not even sure I ever had it in the first place.  I just feel numb and like I don't wana let anybody close ever again. I don't like the idea of vetting people because like I wouldn't wana be vetted like I meet people open and honestly and I expect them to behave the same way. Vetting seems like a game to me but idk maybe thats how you have to be."
emotional,I(18f) feel like my abuse has me completely hating anything sexual and questioning my sexuality,"I've grown up knowing very well that I belonged to the lgbtq community . It took me years to come to terms with that and even longer to come to term with the fact that sexuality is confusing and that I couldn't ever find the exact term I could identify with.   For the past three years or so , I have come to terms with the fact that I'm queer and I've been pretty proud of it .   However , it's been two months since leaving my emotionally abusive ex (18m) ( which was probably sexually abusive as well , but the lines are blurred ) and I think I might be gay and asexual . The realisation occured when i had a sexual ncounter after the break up , it wasn't coercive or anything , it was completely consensual and I even was the one who initiated it  . But after I just didn't like it , I felt nothing . All I could think about was that I just wanted to get over with it , I even stopped it because I frankly didn't feel shit . It's been a couple hours since then and I've been a complete wreck and I feel so nervous I think my hands might drop off.   I think I've realised that the only time I feel safe is when I'm with a girl and that I probably hate sex. I don't know if this is a one time thing or maybe something that would go away but I don't understand this. I'm bringing this up with my counsellor next week but I just want some advice until then , because I don't understand why I'm freaking out so much."
physical,Just left partner (again).,"I've just left an abusive partner and I'm not even sure how much I can say.   I came from an abuse childhood, married to get away (although it later turned out I didn't need to). Around a decade on... I left once a few months back. Left again yesterday.  I don't have as much stuff this time but can hopefully get it back. Worst, I have to leave my dog but have now been told I probably didn't have to - except last time I handed over his insurance to try to smooth arrangements. Last time I was advised to leave him behind.   My partner is very kind to the dog, although he is frightened when they shout or cry lots. They were distraught when I left and the dog really didn't want to get of my lap. It took me a few attempts to move him and slip out the door. I realise this probably makes me look like an awful person.  My partner is very clear that ""over \[their\] dead body"" would I take the dog, but I could have slipped him away when I took him for a wee. I had no where to take him.  I'm not even sure why I'm talking about my dog because I didn't mean to.   The first time I stayed with a friend for a couple of weeks and left exactly on the deadline they'd given me, even though they tried to persuade me to stay longer. I'm not really sure why I went back - I was hungry and cold. I'm disabled and struggle to cook.  The second time - this time - I'd been waiting patiently to make a plan. As someone involved with the disability side (I don't want to use key words) said I could plan to leave better. Two days ago, I just couldn't do it any longer. It would be laughable if I said what happened because it was only a small thing that pushed me over.   I forgot my phone for the meeting - outdoors - and tried to track back their path. I missed them. I was furious. Even though I don't want to die - god knows why, I've got nothing to live for - I was going to hang myself from a tree at the local cemetery - fitting.  I've told no one this. I messaged back when I got in. Said I was sick of waiting for a plan. Kept it short neat. Another friend had offered for an overnight or few nights, but their partner is stricter with the 'new lockdown'. (We've barely come out of lockdown tbh.) No places in domestic abuse service for a week.  Between the missed meeting and arranging stuff, I was outside in negative degrees for about 3 hours. Celsius, before I frighten anyone.  This 'support worker' (not their role) collected me and my stuff from my house. Kept two bags for me. Drove me around the city for hours and dropped me off at a transport location. I flew down to my family with only a few hours notice. Not the awful ones, some improved ones.   I didn't want to because of background and it's far from all my support. I'm furloughed but my work is in the city, hundreds of miles from where I am now. I could be entirely financially supported here.   It would be a better choice.   I want my city though. There's snow - the fresh, crisp air reminds me of a hobby and freedom. I have no fewer than 3 support services involved and a friendship acquaintance network that - while weakened by my partner - was more than enough to get me out the first time.  I've never actually lived where I am now, so I know no one.  I'm still rambling. The support worker said not to talk to them at all. The DV service said the same the first time, but we have a lease. I need to arrange stuff. My partner has called three times today and messaged a fair bit. Nothing abusive, just very sad - wanting me to go back, believing I should help with practical technological solutions which can be solved with a quick google (our smart home). Making out I've left them in literal darkness when the lights operate as dumb lights (and they normally use them as such).  The first time I left I was shitting and vomiting the first night and uneasy but numb and then sad and so on.  I was sad yesterday as well as uneasy. Here I'm myself. I don't even miss my dog. I mean, I must because I keep talking about him and I can hardly stand to look at my screensaver but I'm not distraught. She's distraught. I'm just sort of... going.   It's like my brain thinks I'm on holiday.  I've never had an emotionally involved relationship with this parent. Although they did say (what sounded to my ears) like 'soso' which apparently means 'be strong' (and a few other words). Although parent is a beginner in this language so...  I'm scared of covid. Step-parent works in a place where people have covid and there's the new strain. I am very vulnerable, so am allowed not to work despite being essential. Or, I was scared yesterday.   I shouldn't have got into this relationship. They even showed me a blog post written by someone who abused them before. This person made another one about me being with them - which someone else sent to my partner as a 'watch out: they're spreading lies'. They didn't want to contact me because I was too far gone, although literally no one asked my opinion. I'd never even had a conversation with the blog writer.  Not that it's their responsibility to speak to me, but if you're willing to make a post about it... This was years ago.   My partner did do many nice things for me, so I still love them. I think they need serious help.  I wasn't so bad as to need a multi-disciplinary panel, though I was referred by DV service for being one of their most concerning cases last time. They said their algorithm said I had a 1 in 2 chance of being killed post-break up.  I think this is utterly mad because, well, things genuinely aren't that dangerous. I think the risk got raised because some years ago partner pinned me down by my neck (for cleaning a wall incorrectly). Partner had threatened stalking, turning up at work etc, if I left but didn't follow through (though did want to chat a lot - it's how I got drawn back in).   DV service said not to get complacent because it could change once they realised I really wasn't coming back. Partner has history of stalking and/or harassing two previous partners. Including turning up at one's workplace. They say they've grown up since then.  Partner actually improved over the course of my relationship, but became more willing to be verbally abusive to and in front of our friends. I felt this was a red flag.   I felt the first time after they were threatening to punch me in front of my friends - one in person, two on zoom. Although I can't remember who the third friend was now. In person friend ended up grabbing their first to make them stop.  I want to make out that they went about beating me, because they didn't. They were quite controlling but I struggle to articulate how. As my partner says, it just sounds petty.  How long will it take me to feel properly upset? Surely I should? Is it worse because I'm never emotionally vulnerable here. When will I crash? Am I stupid for wanting to subject myself to poverty (I earn so little) so I can stay with connections and also a better and safer governing body? I feel like it's too specific to say, but I'm not in the middle of nowhere - just different countries of the UK.   I hate being here because it's relatively close to my other parent who was worse, even, than my current partner. Ex partner. I suppose. We'll need to get a divorce."
emotional,"Need advice: Emotionally abused as child by friend, and then in every romantic relationship","I've only recently thought back to my early teenage years, and realized that my best friend and her brother was emotionally abusive.  * When I was 12, my best friend would randomly give me the silent treatment. When I asked her why, she would not give me a reason, but simply not answer.  * She once asked me to kill a silkworm. I didn't want to, but she said I was a chicken if I didn't do it. After I did it, she told her mum how gross I am and that I just killed a silkworm. * She would constantly blame everything on me, making me look bad. For instance, if a rental video was late, she'd tell her mom it's because I still had it. Meanwhile she had lost it. * Her brother and his best friend called me names, like 'pink blob', and made fun of my appearance, likes, pretty much everything about me.  I have had two LTRs and other, shorter relationships and they involved emotional abuse.  * My ex and another partner would call me needy when I asked for my needs to be met, and use degrading nicknames for me. * I have been gaslit in most relationships, and partners often use anger to control my behaviour. * My feelings have always been ignored and dismissed.  I really want to break free from the pattern of having emotional abusive relationships. What has helped you deal with the trauma, and how do you make sure that you don't get involved with similar people?"
emotional,Leaving an abusive relationship,"I've tried leaving and breaking up with my SO many times, but I'm a sensitive person and they are good at using it against me. I get gaslit often, and I feel like a prisoner trapped in a cage for over two years. They really took control over every aspect of my life, to where I'm all alone and dependent on them. I come to realizations often but they're good at getting me to stay. It's a cycle.  I finally have arrangements to leave, but i need some words of encouragement. I don't want to break anyone's heart, but my hearts been broken since not long after the beginning.  Should I tell them I'm leaving, and that I'll love them, but i need to get healthy again? or should I just leave when they're gone? Ty, will be deleting this later."

emotional,Is this emotional abuse?,"Last week I left my boyfriend of 2.5 years. I thought he was the love of my life, we were moving in together on January and I was so excited. He was an amazing boyfriend and we had an overall truly healthy relationship.  I do not think he's an abuser. I think he has insecurities and a bad way of dealing with anger. He's truly aware of abuse in general, I just believe emotional abuse is normal for him (if this is what it was). He's also going to the psychologist to work on his stuff, so I feel guilty for not staying in that process   Here are the things he did: - He went through my phone (he said he saw I looked up his ex and was curious and then found ""sketchy"" conversation with my friends) . The only ""sketchy"" one was with a friend who is also gay so I wasn't flirting.  -He lied about it and confronted me horribly, making me believe someone sent him the conversations. When I confronted him about it, he came clean.  -He started apologizing and when I broke up with him over it , he started saying things like ""you're not gonna find a relationship if you think conflict never happens"", ""you're breaking up with me for the only mistake I ever made so that means you never truly loved me"".  (After that, we went back together. he completely changed, he said he was aware he was wrong about it all, he would work on his insecurities and even read a book on anger management. He truly wanted to grow)   -Three weeks ago, I made a comment within a joke we were making that was ""I will look for someone who will do that for me then"". He got super upset and then said ""he was gonna make a truly hurtful comment and I didn't. Don't make me show you the worst of me""  -The day after, he was still upset. You can read the whole story in a previous post, but he made me choose between forgetting the fact he didn't trust me, or telling me why and break up. He made me search a private conversation he had snooped ""by mistake"". He told me he wasn't even sure of the comment, but he continued with the break up and left.   -when he left, he told me ""thanks for wasting my time  for almost three years""  -three hours later, he texted me to blame me for it all, said things like ""next time you should think better before making comments"", ""you caused this yourself"", ""you're a liar and I don't trust your intentions with me"".   -he then asked to speak but was pressuring me, saying ""he might change his mind later"". A few days later he said he needed to talk and I was being unfair for not wanting to talk to him yet as he was very anxious too.   -I came back again and tried, when I told him I couldn't he said ""he was willing to rebuild it now but later he probably wouldn't"" and ""he knew me enough to know if I didn't give it more days maybe I would feel regretful"". I believed him and stayed.   -That lasted a day, I felt awful and was crying. It felt wrong. I broke with him again and said i was being too severe of him, that it wasn't that big of a deal and I wasn't thinking about how bad he felt about it as well. That it wasn't that bad, he didn't insult me or anything like that. That ""this wouldn't have happened if you hadn't made that comment. Good luck living with that"" and ""good luck finding someone that doesn't get mad when you make a hurtful comment"".   Is it truly emotional abuse? I appreciate any feedback...   :"
physical,"Told my friend if anything ever happened to me, that it's probably my bf who did it","Last weekend, things escalated between me and my bf. I went upstairs to get away from him, to get away from the yelling and slamming things around and throwing things. I sat on my bed and waited, knowing that he was eventually going to come up there. I was afraid. A horrible thought flashed through my mind: what if he kills me? What if he brings the knife he ""joked"" with yesterday upstairs?   So I texted my friend I haven't seen in 20 years, who I trust but isn't involved in my every life. I awkwardly told her that if something happens to me, to look at my bf. I did feel ridiculous to text her that but I felt better after doing it. I told her that I can't tell anyone in my family bc I am estranged from them bc of him and that they would just probably immediately call the police.  Of course, my friend was worried about me, which made me feel worse about even texting her at all. I didn't want to burden her with worry. I don't think I ever told her about when he choked me 3 years ago.  He ended up coming upstairs a couple hours later, and I tried to leave the room but he blocked me, forcing me to hug him first. I just stood there.   I did go to the DV place and talk to someone but the lady said she really didn't know what to tell me about the legal issue of getting him evicted. I'm supposed to apply for legal advice online. It's an in-depth form and I haven't finished it yet.   I am tired of rehashing it all in my head. I am tired of knowing how I feel but living with a man who turns it all around on me, telling me our relationship sucks bc I'm depressed.   I only recently began to realize that him restraining me is not right. He does it all the time. It's not hitting, it's not choking, but it's not right.    I want him out of my house.   This is my struggle and I will not give up. I have no other outlet besides this sub and the narc abuse sub. I'm trying to not hold it all in even though it seems like I'm just going in circles."

physical,I need some advice on how to handle a bad situation,"Let me make this clear! I am 63 years old and have known this female since she was around 8 or 9. I will keep this brief. I am also being forced to obfuscate a lot of this, so please don't think that I am not being truthful because something doesn't add up. OK here goes. I will call her Dawn and she is today a 39-year-old mother of three kids. She was married to a brutal man. During their marriage, Dawn suffered through two broken fingers and even a broken leg. Her husband slapped her once when she was 4 months pregnant. This is not really the story that leads up to my question. She was able to escape and is today married to a great man that is actually a one-star officer in one of the US Military Services. I have met him and have shared some beers with him. While I am not Dawn's father I am the closest thing she has to one. This abuse was not something she shared with me so I was not made aware of it until well after she escaped and got divorced. Dawn was left with panic attacks and suffers from PTSD. Loud male voices scare her and according to her current husband, most times results in her shaking in a fetal position.  The husband, however, needs her to be active in social functions and her attendance is almost mandatory. These functions scare her and the few times she goes to one does not last long. The husband is understanding, but this is causing issues with his career. This in turn is causing Dawn more problems and is withdrawing more and more. She sent me an email and honestly I'm at a loss. What do I tell her? I am currently not in the US I am in Belgium on business, but she has asked me for access to my apartment. Do I give it to her? This is a really messed up situation and I am really at a loss. My main issue is I can't relate to her fears. I am getting angry at her husband because he seems to be placing his career over her mental health. Help!"

emotional,Did I (27F) lose the love of my life (27M) or did I just dodge a bullet of an emotionally abusive relationship?,"Long story short, my ex said we had to break up because he wasn't happy and felt like I couldn't make him feel loved or appreciated because I didn't love myself.   We dated for a year and it was almost unbelievably good for the first 6 months. Then when he was on a trip I moved things around in his apartment thinking I was being helpful, we got into huge fights in which he called me a narcissist and threatened to punch me. We took a break but after I showed him how much ""work"" I did (reading books, Journaling, therapy, asking myself the ""hard questions"" he told me) we got back together but I felt he always had contempt for me since. During our break he even told me I had to cut off ties with my narcisstic mother or we were done. I did and I didn't talk to my mom for 5 months. He was very critical, about the way I move, talk, joke, initiate sex, etc. But would always say the right things like, I love you unconditionally, you're always enough, I love comforting you, etc. Whenever I was upset over something he did, he would deny it and blame my narcissism or borderline personality disorder (both which he diagnosed me with) or my childhood abuse or my abandonment issues, or a big fat ""that's how you remember things?"" By the end of our relationship my confidence has plummeted, my self image and self worth diminished, and I feel like I can't even trust my own intuition or mind, like I'm crazy. He treated me like (and told me I was) sick and needed extensive serious therapy. I'm currently in EDMR therapy. He would diminish me but then would be like ""Im so proud of you, you're getting so much better."" but then I'd have to hear semi frequently about how he's not happy in this relationship.  When he dumped me, initially I was devastated. I feel like I have this dream of what are relationship could be and hanging on to that kept me from seeing the relationship as it really is. I told him I was relieved cause I wasn't getting what I needed either but he was right on it to tell me it's my fault. The whole thing was my fault. My friends, family, didn't like him and say I'm better off but I still wake up every morning and don't want to get out of bed because I'm scared I lost the best love I'll ever get.  I'm looking for reassurance that these are red flags of emotional abuse and that I should never get back with him again. I just need confirmation, please."
physical,My girlfriends cousin assaulted her,"Long story short, my girlfriends cousin is trying to move In with them and he stays in my girlfriends bed for the time being while they sort out the living situation, i don__ mind because they__e cousins but he ends up fingering her in her sleep whiles she__ drunk, like black out drunk and she wakes up and says stop and they both go back to bed but my gf isn__ actually sure anything went down . To my knowledge he dips the next day or something and my girlfriend hasn__ really talked about it all that much and is too afraid to talk about it because it would ruin a lot of relationship but that__ doesn__ make sense because this was before anything happened witn her cousin and her friend had a baby.   Now this might make seem like a bad person but my gf and this cousin are really close still and they hang out and smoke weed together and she says they aren__ but I see it when I__ around them they seem totally normal and it really rubs me the wrong way. She won__ let me do anything about this and it just makes me so mad because it just seems weird.   Idk if I__ being a horrible human but I feel like they might have done soMeaning while they__e drunk, she__ been raped twice before and she__ cried and been unbelievably sad and hasn__ talked to those guys ever Again and I find it weird she buddy buddy with her cousins.   I do love my gf but I have horrible anxiety and I know this situation is only hurting her and our relationship and I can__ help but get this horrible feeling about  it  Everytime I try to bring it up she gets uncomfortable and refuses to talk about it, but I think It__ better if we do.  When I bring it up she__ cries and says she wouldn__ fake or lie about being assaulted or anything like that and that I don__ get how hard it is and that she__ too afraid to bring it up to anyone and if she does she__ afraid of getting made fun of or blamed for instigating it or something, this same cousin did the same thing to his now gf and my girlfriend was gonna bring it up but didn__ wanna ruin her relationship with her best friend, she says it__ easier to just pretend nothing happened but that bothers me that her cousin still contacts her and shit and they hang out in groups I just get a weird vibe, the only people she has told is me and her mom and I want to tell more people but gets mad and starts to break down. This is the 3rd time she__ being assaulted like this but I think she__ too afraid of the repercussions to do anything about it, also I know she was drinking with her and friend and blacked out and she woke up to this guy fingering her. She tells me she__ get a lie detector test to prove she__ not lying and nothing was consensual."
emotional,Feeling guilty for being happy and accepting end of relationship too fast?,"Long story short: I recently completely cut off my sibling and, as a result, a good chunk of my family.   I was absolutely devestated for the first week but was firm on no contact. I'm currently seeing a therapist who's suggesting I go not contact for a minimum of 1 yeara. I'm surrounded by a lot of positive support right now, which really helps.   I feel like I'm moving on with my life too fast considering the gravity of the loss. The vast majority of my immediate family gone, pretty much.   Did anyone else here feel a similar weird feeling? Like you should be more crushed or going through more mourning?"

physical,Am I in the wrong for not wanting to speak to my parents?,"Long story short; I (f26) was living with my parents for the time being, as I was in between jobs. One day my brother (24) came over and we started having an argument, it led to him getting physically violent with me, and had it not been for my dad protecting me, who knows what it could have led to. My parents promised me he would not be allowed to step foot inside in the house while I was there. Of course my parents condemned him for what he did, but the next day they were also running errands for him and talking like nothing. It stung a bit, but I just assumed I didn't get the full picture.   Literally a week later, he was in the house while I was away on a day-trip. When my dad picked me up he told me that my brother had been in the house and he wasn't sure if he's still there, but that he thinks that he has left by now. I felt so raged and started saying that my dad has promised he wouldn't come around, but my dad was kind of denying the promise and saying at the end of the day that I can stay in my room. The fight actually started with me being in my room and my brother barging in there. I felt so powerless in that moment that I started looking for flats, I didn't care that I had to use all my savings, I just wanted to get out. I was really lucky in finding a flat really quickly, and I just left without saying good-bye to my parents (they knew I got a flat). Now they keep on messaging and calling me and I'm ignoring them. I just need my own space, physically and emotionally and don't want to speak to anyone in my family at the moment. Am I in the wrong?"
emotional,Lost Love,"Lying in bed, watching the fairy lights hanging  The mellow light, diffusing, the dark spots glistening  As seeping through the room, myriad memories floating  In the cold frosty night, the soothing sullenness wafting  My body feels the vigor, the frequency your smile carrying  Hiding in broken promises, the moments we spent cherishing  The good memories sparking, the bad memories aching  [Complete](https://www.msmsol.com/2021/01/lost-love.html?m=1)"
emotional,Almost cheated on my emotionally abusive ex,"M (28) dated F (26) for about a year. She and I met through mutual friends and so it was easier to let my guard down fully with her. After about a month of dating we went exclusive.   She did a lot of things in that relationship that I have learned were emotionally abusive. She would do something that seemed really sweet and then tell me at the last moment that she really did it for herself. An example is, she invited me out on a date and got me to drive 50 miles to see her. Then told me she used me to avoid going to a party for a guy she had sex with once. That kind of crap wasn't the end of it. Gaslighting, massive mood swings, accusations that made no sense, etc...   The whole reason I put up with it is because she told me sob stories that I bought hook line and sinker... I put up with it for about a year and then she met my family for the first time. She had no issue trying to treat me like she was trying to control me in front of them, slapping my hands harder and harder, giving me dirty looks frequently when she could. My family noticed and helped me realize what a POS she was.   We got in my car and she started accusing me of using my family to test her and for emotionally abusing my nephew at the dinner table. First one made my head spin, second one did some major damage. My father was extremely emotionally abusive and I never wanted to be like him, and she knew that. Took my family and nephew about 3 months to convince me that I didn't emotionally abuse my nephew by gently teasing him about spilling his water at the table.   After I somewhat snapped out of it, I had an overwhelming urge to cheat on her and almost did it. Looking back on it I felt like I just wanted to connect with anyone else other than her. I started a dating profile and came really damned close to arranging dates with around 5 or more women. Then I caught myself. I realized that wasn't who I wanted to be, even though I felt so angry at her for how she took advantage of my trust.   I came clean with those women about the fact that I was in a relationship and apologized to them. I however did not apologize to my ex and still don't feel like I should have. Those women didn't deserve to be used. My ex deserved to be dumped. And to hell with her.  I dumped her. And she immediately started the sob stories no doubt. Lost those mutual friends.   I guess my questions are, how much flak should I give myself over my behavior? Should I have felt more apologetic towards my ex? Am I someone who is at risk of potentially cheating in the future?  TLDR; Almost cheated on an emotionally abusive ex, but ended up dumping her and didn't feel bad about it. Does that make me a bad person?"
emotional,But she is changing_,"Married 8 years. Seeing that everyone is in here for a reason, I__l skip the formalities. Back in October when it came down to me ready to throw in the towel, she said she would change and go to therapy. I caved. We__e been in therapy (individuals and couples) since November and she has made a ton of progress. Most of the really big changes within the last week. She is upset that I am not trying but I feel so destroyed that her touch hurts my insides (I am able to hug though). My family is really encouraged seeing her progress. On the other hand, I keep getting the impression that I am the one screwing up and not trying. She doesn__ disagree to this. She has barely begun her process of healing from her trauma and made such a turnaround that it makes me not trust how she is acting.   Am I in the wrong for still wanting to leave? Should I be giving her more of a chance? I__e endured this abuse for 8+ years only to have her try within the last few weeks. I just can__ see me ever fully trusting her and allowing myself to be who I really am."
physical,Should this be considered physical abuse?,"Me (22F) and my fiance (23M) have been together for a few years now and the wedding is in 3 months. We've had a tough couple of months this year and our fights have been getting pretty bad lately. We just recently moved into a new apartment complex and we had a fight this morning. I was raising my voice and he kinda was too, but I was never loud enough for any of the neighbors to hear me at all. Out of anger, or he said to ""quiet me down"", he grabbed me and held me as tight as he could, almost like in a chokehold, and held his hand over my mouth so tight for about 30 seconds, then moved his hand up to my nose for another 20-30 after he realized I was still making noise through my nose, crying, trying to get him to let go. He finally let go and I pushed him off and he proceeded to shove me over the edge of the couch and held me down for about a minute, not letting me get up. I was hyperventilating and freaking out because he had me so tight I couldn't move. He later told me he did it to quiet me down and said he would easily do it again if I decided to act like a ""fucking baby infant"" and raise my voice again.  He has barely ever shown any kind of aggression or anger in this way, and he's never laid a hand on me like this before. I don't know what to do..."
physical,"Bf has been very irritated recently, I'm walking on eggshells.","Me (28) and my bf (29) live together. No kids. Together for 6 years.   He's been very irritable since he stopped taking his antidepressants almost two months ago.   Today he asked my help with something and I tried to help but wasn't fast enough. He got angry and slapped my hand hard. It hurt and my hand was red and sore for at least an hour. He also said I'm as smart as a monkey.   He then proceeded to apologize AND blame me for the slap : I was too slow and useless..   In the past month he's called me senile, retard, useless, yelled at me to shut up. This happens a few times a week.   Last night I had a mental breakdown due to his actions. He wasn't supporting me during it. Pretty much just said I'm not doing enough to help myself at counseling.  He said he considered calling an ambulance to lock me up at a mental hospital instead of hugging me.. Because I'm a danger to myself apparently.   I don't know what to do. I'm suicidally depressed. I'm just too tired.   Sorry if I don't answer. I'm not sure if it's safe.   I will be okay. I just.. I can't tell anyone. Because I'm causing him to act like this by being useless.    What should I do? I'd like to bring up therapy with him but I don't think he'd react well."
emotional,how bad is it?,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for 2 years. I broke up with him in May due to his abusive behavior. I was at a low point and reached out, and it escalated to a relationship from there. No one knows Im with him. My family and therapist hate him and constantly tell me to leave and say he is emotionally and verbally abusive. I've seen the flags early on. I wanted to list some of the things hes done as a sort of catharsis, but also for some validation. He has convinced me I am crazy and I exaggerate, despite never having these problems with anyone else that had ever been in my life   -calls me names often (stupid, bitch, crazy, a fucking baby, go fuck yourself, fuck off, leave me alone, whore, liar, etc) -told me he'd leave me if i was raped because he ""didnt sign up for that"" -told me he'd leave me if I ever slept with a Black guy because that would ""alter his perception of me"" (but that he'd be fine with other girlfriends doing it?) -constantly pressures me to do anal. Says I'd like it, other women he's been with enjoy it. One time I caved (it was my idea at the time) but said I only wanted to try it briefly. He got me super high and it was horrible. After I said to stop I showered alone in the dark and cried on his couch. He didnt come check on me and just played videogames with his friends. I felt used and dirty.  -often says he doesn't wanna be with me anymore after minor fights -constantly blames me for the same behaviors hes doing to me (gaslighting, manipulating, etc) -constantly accuses me of cheating on him, says all of his friends and family think Im a lying slut -starts fights and pretends I started them. Denies events and conversations that i KNOW happened -would slyly make me send pictures so he could verify my location -never apologizes or gives fake apologies that place blame on me -belittles the way I dress, implying I have no self respect for having cleavage (Im a DD its bound to occur) -says he doesnt trust me to take care of myself, implying Im always going to get raped or assaulted -blames me for men harassing me and my feeling uncomfortable -left town on the day of my college graduation. He told me he would leave the day after but decided to leave before. Didnt come to my ceremony -very racist and sexist -says Im ""depressing to be around"" and complains about any admonishment of sadness. I never mention my sadness anymore. He doesnt care -never excited for anything I mention, always makes it negative somehow. Ruins my mood constantly -never prioritizes me. He even admitted this and that he basically sees me as a penpal (we're long distance) -openly admitted he would say things intentionally to hurt me -I got a puppy that hes never met, and I never say anything bad about. One day I said he was turning into a good dog, and he was trying to diminish it and said ""sounds like hes just growing up"". I asked why he cant just be happy for me. He said ""i just dont like ""(dogs name)"", sue me!"" He put the dogs name in quotes because he thinks its a dumb name.  -took a screenshot after he said ""go cry then. Youre a fucking baby. Leave me the fuck alone"". He exploded on me. Called me psychotic, a crazy bitch. Said he'd block me and Id never hear from him again. He thought I was going to share the screenshots but I just wanted them for record of how bad he treats me and because I knew hed deny the whole situation. He said ""you don't ever fucking do this to me"" and said I should beg for his forgiveness.  -constantly dismisses my feelings and doesnt care how his actions make me feel. Says I should stop being so dramatic, playing the victim, grow up, stop being a baby, etc.   Anyways these arent all the incidents but theyre the most salient ones. I know it all sounds bad in a row like this. And I know it is bad. But I just feel so crazy and confused. I need perspective from strangers.  Sorry if formatting is off, I'm on mobile."

After 15 minutes of his location saying he was standing near the mailboxes around the corner, I walked outside to see if I could find him. Around the corner were two police vehicles with their lights on, and two officers talking to my boyfriend who was sitting on the curb.

emotional,My abuse was quiet,"My abuse happened to me quietly and slowly--not all of a sudden, or with the fanfare of yelling, bruises, broken plates, or awful names, but between two people sitting, quietly conversing behind closed doors. My abuse happened in murmurs and between pregnant pauses, in cancelled plans, and in the tenderness and respect that he once showed for me unceremoniously seeping out of the corners of the room, leaving me cold and alone.  It happened it what was said _ calmy, and articulately, but with wild inconsistencies and gently folded in accusations. It happened in rolling over with seeming indifference to try to fall asleep while I was crying beside him. It happened in the stiff silences that would last for hours or even days at a time. It happened in the repeated requests for just a bit more patience and understanding, requests that slowly crept further and further away from what I ever thought I would tolerate, and became a labyrinth of contradictory rules that were increasingly impossible to navigate.   The appearance of waiting for a better time to have a conversation became the total avoidance of accountability. An ecosystem of love and warmth was slowly warped into the quiet demand for unconditional acceptance of whatever behaviours came out of his pain. My abuse happened out of the twisting of mental illness into a blank cheque for his behaviour.   He never told me I was crazy, but I felt crazy, from his selective forgetting, changing promises, small undermining of my reality, unpredictable responses or drastic changes in opinion, accusing me of over-reacting, and withholding information. I was never accused of having memory problems or losing my mind, but I felt like I was anyways.   My physical safety was never directly threatened, but instead I got vague statements about losing control or not knowing what he would do if he was pushed further. He never directly threatened me with suicide if I left, but rather calmy informed me that he probably wouldn__ want to keep living if we weren__ together.  My abuse happened in negotiations about meeting both of our needs that somehow always ended with my compromise. It happened in broken promises and lies and empty apologies.   I was never told that my interests were stupid and my accomplishments were never ridiculed, but there was increasingly less oxygen in the room for my any part of my internal world. Trying to share even the smallest ongoing in my life felt like screaming into a void. I was made to feel selfish for daring to voice my needs or of asking anything more of my partner.    Things like where I went, who I saw, or what I wore, were never controlled or of any issue. It took me months after to realize I was still being controlled in less obvious ways. Where, when, and how we spent time together; when or if we communicated about our relationship, for how long, and about what; even at what times of day it was acceptable to talk -- were are controlled. Not through telling me how things were going to be or making demands, but through rigidity and intolerance of alternatives. There was the appearance of conversation/negotiation between two equals, but having the narrower limits and an unwillingness to compromise will reliably give someone power over that decision. He was, in essence, un-influenceable. My feelings, opinions, preferences, and needs, were like water off a duck__ back.  If this sounds just like dating someone who is somewhat disinterested or was stringing me along, allow me to clarify. Amid everything I just shared -- I was told regularly how he__ never felt this way about someone, his commitment to our future and to making this work, how lucky he felt to be with me, and that I was the most important part of his life. I was told that what was happening to me was love. Perhaps even more perniciously, I was also sent the message that what I was being asked to do was to love _ that I was loving well by twisting myself to meet all of my partner__ needs and by accepting all of their behaviour without question, at whatever cost to me.   For every claim I just made, there are several counterexamples that come to mind__imes when I received a lot of affection and support. But rather than balancing the scales, the inconsistency and unpredictability itself was a requisite part of the abuse. It acted as a maintaining mechanism. A powerful apology here, a few weeks of calm, promises of change that start to show some follow-through _ all kept me stuck. It gave me hope, it created the appearance of reasonableness and credibility__uch I felt crazy and unreasonable for being bothered by the hurtful behaviours, and I started to adapt to letting these morsels of care and respect sustain me, when in actuality, I was emotionally malnourished, slowly and quietly wasting away."
emotional,You can never justify atrocity just because you had good intention,"My abused me verbally, emotionally, and physically when I was a kid because I wasn't an ideal student. When I was young, I thought the way he scolded me was normal, as in at least acceptable within cultural norm of my country (I'm Korean-American). But you learn thing or two about what is acceptable and wrong when you grow up and I realized that my father justified literally every atrocious shit he did on me just because first he was providing me, second because I'm his son and he did it out of love, third as a son I had the ""obligation"" to take his shit and since I was a ""shitty son"" that I owed him that, and last but not least, because it's how its supposed to be.   My father dominated, invaded, and owned me when I was a kid emotionally and mentally. My self esteem was rock bottom. I've made very bad friends because of it. I had a lot of issues with self-esteem, mental health, friendship issue etc.   I gave him the benefit of doubt. Thinking that since he did it out of love and caringness, it was acceptable. BULLSHIT. FUCK THAT. You can NEVER fucking justify abuse. Period. No matter how much of a good intention you have or love, you can never treat someone like shit and call it love. Fuck these people.   I will never love my father. He thinks he did what war right but I've been dealing with his shit for 25 years living as a slave to him because he ""provided for me and sacrificed for me"". I was never fucking asked to be born and I owe him to be living by serving him as an indentured servant?   I hear by tell you: You can never justify abuse. When people near you don't make change and continue on with their bullshit, cut them off from your life. It doesn't matter who it is. They don't deserve you. You deserve better. Never talk to them. Don't even think about them. Don't forgive. Ignore and live and move on with your life.   Whatever reason these fuckers had, do not care about it. Once you listen to their justification, it will be an endless cycle of repetitive toxicity that you will be putting yourself through. I will never forgive my father and he will never be part of my future life. You did it out of love? Fuck you. Love my ass. It doesn't mean you can treat me like utter shit and call it love. Then I could massacre 3.5 billion people and call it a humanitarian recycling.   Seriously, fuck these people."
emotional,You can never justify atrocity just because you had good intention,"My abused me verbally, emotionally, and physically when I was a kid because I wasn't an ideal student.

physical,How did you officially cut ties with your abuser? *trigger warning*,"My abuser is also my husband and the father of my child. I am not in love with him and I__ honestly just with him so he could help with our child.  But I honestly can__ do it anymore. This isn__ the first time he__ hit me or her. Today it was me and it__ bad. He choked me 3 times, to the point where it hurts to swallow, and it hurts where he put his hand on my neck. His choice of abuse is to always choke me. He__ also scratched my neck  I want to call the police but I can__. I feel so fucking guilty. I feel bad for him, even after all the shit he does to me, I feel terrible. He__ my husband and my daughter__ dad. I feel like a monster to do that to him. But he doesn__ feel like a monster when he does this to me."
emotional,building friendships after controlling abuse is hard,"my abusive ex convinced me that any connection i made outside of our relationship was a violation of our monogamous agreement. even if the connections were entirely platonic, he would accuse me of cheating on him if the person seemed at all important to me. In this way he controlled who I was 'allowed' to see.   I avoided romantic relationships for a long time after the abusive one. now I'm finally in a healthy and safe romantic relationship, and I'm having a difficult time building friendships outside of it. I can't shake this fear that if I make real friends, my partner will accuse me of cheating. I seem to have internalized the notion that any form of love with someone else is unsafe for me.  I think genuine intimacy is just scary after the abuse GENERALLY, because it was so traumatic. I'm realizing that my apprehensions about vulnerability are not just relegated to romance.  Can anyone relate?"
physical,Teaching myself that I__ not going to get an apology,My abusive ex doesn__ even consider himself to have done anything wrong. He literally tried to explain to me how *I gave myself a black eye* with his fist ? Somehow? It__ mad delusional but in any case_. No way is he ever apologizing for doing that  He broke my computer right in front of me and then tried to tell me that it was my fault (?!?!!?!)  It__ awful living with this and then just realizing that at the end of the day I need to just get over this and move on. Sometimes I literally try to convince myself that he__ dead and it makes me feel better. I don__ know if anyone has advice?!!?
physical,TW: Feeling guilty nervous and anxious,"My bf (31) and i (29f) have been off and on for about 3 years. We got pregnant during lockdown and now have the most amazing beautiful 10 month old  in the world.  We were finally able to go on a date night- I drove since I__ not drinking. I was apprehensive to go out because when he drinks he__ a totally different person.  The night started off good with appetizers at a bar, then we went to a comedy show where we were almost kicked out do to him talking and throwing stuff at the women in front of us who shushed him.  We gambled a little and we__e up about 2k but he kept trying to pull my dress down and expose my breasts, he would pinch my nipples till I would try to hold in my screams. He started pushing down my fingers making it feel like they were going to break.  I wanted to leave after he lost all the money and just be with the baby but he said it was to early_ it was 1130 I was tired and we did a lot.  Well we walk back to the car he pisses on some strangers car and he takes a gun from under the passenger seat (I had NO idea it was there)  He takes out the clip or magazine whatever it__ called and says he__l pistol whip a car- he tried on 2 he couldn__ do it and I hit the clip in my purse.  We get out of the parking garage and he grabs my hair and says he has the upper hand in more way then one- he then looks at the gun. I can__ drive he keeps pulling at me, trying to crush my fingers at one point I was driving with my knees. I pulled over a total of 3 times because I refuse to drive like that. I kept honking my horn hoping I__ get pulled over.   He holds both my arms behind my back in the car and tries to find my phone- he gets it and he throws it out the door over by the back of an apartment complex.  When we get home he won__ let me out of the car I take off my heel and try to hit him with it- he grabs my purse and threw it in the street and locks me out- I ring the doorbell over and over and he lets me in after my sister(who lives with us and was watching the baby) asks what__ going on.   I run to my room tell her to take the baby to her room and call 911.  I grab the gun I keep in a safe next to my bed(I__ not a gun person I HATE guns but before we were 2 single girls living alone and I thought keeping one in a safe would be a good idea) his finger prints are also used to open the safe. I take it out and he__ like __hat are you going to do with that_ I put it back in the lockbox and carry the box. I sit in the living room trying to compose myself and he comes with a gun pointed to me and says __ow do you like having a gun pointed at you, like how that feels?_ I scream and run to my sisters room and were locked in the bathroom with the baby.  He was arrested but I was almost to, they said it was he said she said and he had scratches on his neck.  It wasn__ till they went to my car and. Saw all the hair he pulled out that they believed my side.  I begged them to look at surveillance from the casino we were at.  Cps came and told me if I want to keep my daughter I need to file a TPO.   Hes in jail I filed the TPO.  But now I feel like it__ all my fault, I feel guilty tellling my sister to call the police. But I was so scared.  Were never getting back together which is probably for the best but I can__ help feeling like shit"
physical,Is this abuse?,My BF had me go on a date in a black neighborhood restaurant.  He had black coworkers there.  I was scared for my life.  I told him how I felt and he said he will keep taking me to black friend meeting dates.  I am a petite white woman.
physical,Confused and don__ know what to do,"My boyfriend (m45) and I (f44) have fought_ a lot. We__e been in a long distance relationship for 2 1/2 years, and about 3 months ago he moved across the country, I moved an hour away, and we joined households.  Last night, we had another fight, and he pushed me down.  I hit my head on our hardwood floors, and I was knocked out for about 2 minutes.  He called the EMS, and they were accompanied by the police.  He told them exactly what happened and owned everything.  And now he is in jail facing felony charges.  I don__ want to ruin his life.  I don__ want to think this is it.  I don__ know what to do.  I reached out to exactly one person in the past 24 hours, and she said he is dead, our relationship is dead to her, and if I don__ get out, I__ dead to her.  He called and asked for a couple of health items (glasses, etc) and I dropped them off at the jail tonight.  He wants me to take his ATM card to get cash for his bail tomorrow. It__ a massive amount, and I don__ feel comfortable taking it out, regardless of if it__ his account with his ATM pin which he gave me because I don__ want to get in trouble for using someone else__ ATM card.  I__ just lost as to what to do.  I don__ want him to suffer.   I don__ think this is him - he__ not violent; it was a one off in a fight, and we were both saying horrible things to each other.  Please talk to me."
emotional,Broken doll,My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. Hes cheated on me so many times. Usually over internet. I try to look past it. He puts me down and makes remarks about my mental illnesses when we argue. He threatens to break up with me. He screams at me when we fight. He has even said he's ruined my life. But continues to do what he does. I can't talk to him about anything. Anything to do with my insecurities he gets so mad. Anytime I cry it pisses him off. I don't have the courage to end it. Because I know how bad its gonna hurt when I have to watch him pack his things and leave. Idk what to do anymore. I'm trying so hard but I feel like I'm so lost. I'm exhausted. I love him but I don't know what to do anymore.

physical,My bf (25F) breaks my (26F) things when he__ angry,"My boyfriend and I have been together for over a year now, we live together. I feel like everyone says this_but we do have a really great relationship aside from the fact that he breaks and throws things when he__ angry.  To break it down, here are a few things he__ done: First time, he broke my dresser after I moved in. We had a fight, and he was slamming my dresser around screaming at me to leave, threw all my clothes out, etc. Second time, he poured a drink on my head. That made me feel humiliated. I remember crying in the shower rinsing my hair out. Most recent time, he broke my hand painted drink coasters that I made as a hobby. To be fair I had thrown one at him in anger and walked away. But then he came into our room with all of them, and broke them all in half in front of me. All of them. I had worked on them for weeks. In the back of my mind, I know this isn__ okay. But I would love an outside perspective and I really need advice. I love him very much, but when he rages like this it traumatizes me.  FOR REFERENCE: I have nowhere to go. My family lives out of state. I don__ make enough money from my job to live on my own. I haven__ saved any money. Idk what to do."
physical,am i in a slowly escalating abusive relationship,"my boyfriend hurt me today. i was jokingly making fun of him and he ran towards me and started chocking me, I thought it was a joke but it really started to hurt so i tried to say this actually hurts and then he let go of me. after I told him it actually hurt he blamed me and said I should be careful of what I say. it sounds like he was threathening me and this has happened before, he has said stuff like I should not make him mad and I should be careful. he gets mad and punches the walls sometimes and Im kind of scared by this. he talks about his anger and how he kind of understands people even killing someone because of anger. he says his anger can take control of him and that it could get to a point where he doesnt controll it anymore.   what do you think about this? am I just paranoid or could this escalate to something"
physical,Why can__ I figure this out?,"My boyfriend is threating to ruin all my things, and my car. It__ not the first time, and I__ currently at work about to get off. I finally gained some courage, and called my local police department about it, and she stated for me to call back in the morning when I get off. She also said because he lives with me they can ask him to leave, but can__ make him leave. She also said I would have to process I think and eviction notice etc...I__ afraid If they come to my house he won__ leave, and that__ going to make a bigger mess. Anyway it__ hard trying to contact ppl during the day because he__ home. I just seem to struggle going about this. I__e even contacted a domestic violence place, and gave me numbers. I__ gonna try again. If someone can also encourage me because I end up chickening out, but I need him out of my life ASAP!"
physical,Warning signs of DV,"My boyfriend of 2.5 years flares up at little things often and is very irritable. He will yell at the top of his voice when he loses it - although these are rare occasions. He has never physically abused me or punched stuff/ kicked things but sometimes his temperament scares me.  I am keen to know what are the initial signs of DV, what red flags I must be wary of? Also how many months or years in to the relationship did the abuse begin?"
physical,He acts as if he did nothing.,"My boyfriend of 4 1/2 years, and father to 2 of my kids and I got into an argument last night. He has cheated on me and lied to me, and was on a girls profile or something and I came home from work &amp; got upset and he acted as if he didn__ do anything wrong when I__e told him this was against my boundaries because of his past. Fast forward an hour or less later I__ in the bedroom and hear him talking bad about me and being __ontrolling_ to his friend, they went on for about 30 minutes. When he came to bed I asked about it but he refused to talk to me and ignored me/pretended to be sleeping. To get his attention I flicked him and said __ello_ , so he slapped me across the face and said __hat the hell is your problem_ I went to the couch. And he came out about 20 minutes later with a half assed apology and I told him I didn__ want to hear anything &amp; we just go to bed for the night and re visit this tomorrow.  Instead he grabbed his things and left and told me not to call him. Came back the next morning &amp; acted as if nothing happened. Tried cuddling up to me, talking to me while I__ at work. Acting like he didn__ just slap me across the face. He is financially irresponsible I work 3-4 jobs trying to keep us afloat and he just got a job about 2 months ago.  He__ cheated on me while I was pregnant and right after I had our daughter. He constantly lies, Checks out other women , watches videos of girl twerking &amp; things online, porn. Etc. And now, a slap to the face &amp; acting as if he didn__.  I__ really just at a loss, and not sure what to do. I have no family &amp; no where to go.  No one to watch my kids at night while I work. I just don__ know what to do. There__ 0 remorse."
physical,I__ finally escaping.,"My boyfriend of two years had hit his lowest in our relationship and i refuse to let it get any worse. It started off with me saying a comment while we were having intercourse but he sat down for a minute so I said __re we done? why are you putting in your boxers?_ Immediately he flew to me and slapped me in my face. So i started crying and he got even more mad and started punching me in my head. I started to defend myself, which he didn__ like and he went ten times harder hitting me. i have bruises all over my face, my lips are blue and were swollen. I couldn__ seem to escape him. He would follow me to the bathroom when i was trying to collect myself and come beat me again. i was so scared for my life. Then he gets on his knees and tells me i won__ make it anywhere without him. I have no family so he knows i have no where to go. I was going to call the cops but i have two kids. (he__ not the father) and he would scare me into not doing so because they would take away my kids. His mother came and calmed the situation and he slept at her house.  The following day, He comes back and tells me that i need to not question him. That me doing that gets him mad and that__ why he acts how he acts. he really doesn__ see that he is at fault. he is really blaming me that he has to hit me. __or you being you_ is why he said he hit me . I showed him all my bruises, lumps, scratches and you know what he said to that? __ook at me , i have scratches everywhere_ like are u serious? that was ME DEFENDING MYSELF!!!! i cant  believe abusers think this way.  This was just the most recent incident though. The last one i had to call the cops because he hit me in front of my kids. They arrested him and i filed a temp restraining order against him. When it came down to making it permanent, i told the judge no. i thought he learned his lesson after spending a night in jail but nope. it only got worse.  He__ verbally abusive to me and my kids. He__ thrown me around, pulled my hair, slapped me, spit on me, punches the back of my head. and i made excuses for him everytime. thought to myself maybe i was the problem , maybe i bother him .. etc.. but nope. for some reason i finally could see who he really is. i don__ know why i made excuses for him, i guess i was desperate for love but it__ funny bc a man who loves you would never EVER put hands on you. no matter how __nnoying_ you are. i realized this that night and i__ so glad i recorded most of the verbal argument so i can go back and listen everytime i feel like i miss him. nobody should go through this but it__ so hard to leave. nobody talks about how hard it is to leave such a bad relationship. but i__ doing it guys.. i spoke to a long term bestfriend of mine and he has agreed to take me and the kids in. i__ forever grateful. i leave this thursday with the help of my coworkers to help me move my stuff out while he is at work. I__ so scared but excited to start my process of healing. I thank God for giving me the strength i never knew i had. You have it too."
physical,My brother beats me (22F) and is very aggressive that I no longer feel safe at home.,"My brother has always been physically abusive but lately his anger issues have got out of hand. He basically beats doors and walls and even fights with our dog when he's angry. We basically walk on eggshells around him and he doesn't show any signs before things escalate. I have developed a reflex to run to my room and lock the door every time I think he might hurt me or is about to get angry. I have money to move out, but since we have a single mom, it's too complicated to leave and she won't agree. I am super scared that I feel tense hours after he blasts out."
physical,How should I approach this?,"My brother who had a dark and turbulent past confided in my once about something he did. The vibe of the conversation wasn't one of grief, shame, or remorse. We were talking about women. Well, he told me he once knocked his ex wife unconscious and then preceded to have anal sex with her.   How should I be responding to this?  Should I be holding him accountable?    I expressed no shame and remorse for this."
physical,I need advice,"My college roommate (let__ call her Abby) has a boyfriend (let__ call him Jack). This started ~October 17th, when she asked for my opinion on a couple stories about them. Idiot pushed her too hard on a workout that they were doing together and she tells me several instances of verbal abuse (__f you think you__e fat you probably are_ __ou__e overreacting _, etc.). I tried to get help the next day on campus with the Office of Violence Prevention and they told me they can only intervene if it__ physical or sexual abuse. Day after that Abby told me a very terrifying story: Jack wanted to have sex with her, she said __ot without a condom_. They did not find protection and they did it anyway. She didn__ say __o_ per se, but it wasn__ an explicit yes. I think that it was most likely rape. They broke up. Abby initially wanted an investigation (and I highly encouraged this option). However, she changed her mind and decided not to. I didn__ agree, but I respect her decision as her own. On Halloween, she told me that her and Jack are back together. I was stunned. She asked, __re you mad at me?_ I replied, __o, but I__ highly concerned. Tell me the second he starts treating you shit_. I wanted to report the case anonymously but was discouraged by my other roommates, who think I should wait for Abby to come forward if she has a problem. I__ very concerned and confused. Should I wait for Abby to come talk with me or should I intervene anyway?"
physical,I don__ know how I feel but I__ still shaking.,"My dad has started to hit my mom. Today was the fourth time this year. They got into an argument about my sister and he started hitting her. I tried to break up the fight but in the end, I panicked and dialled 911.   The cops came and they talked to my parents. They made up some ridiculous lie about my sister and I fighting over a stuffed toy. I__ 16. I don__ play with stuffed toys anymore.  One cop pulled me aside and asked what I saw. My mom was standing there glaring at me so I said I heard screaming and that was it. I chickened out and lied.  My mom doesn__ want my dad to go to jail. I__e tried explaining to her that she could tell the truth and won__ have to press charges. The cop told my sister and I to stop fighting and don__ call them over small things like this. Now I look like a idiot. I don__ know how I feel and what to do."
physical,is it my fault,"My dad hurts me. He put his foot on my back the other week and i asked him to move it and then I pushed his leg away, he looked really red and angry and started throwing things at me, yanking my hair out, punching me, and stomping on my face.  My family says it__ my fault and I__ an idiot   My brother slapped me for being scared to go to the basement at 2am- at the time, u had to leave out of the house and around, through a shared driveway, then open heavy storm doors. I don__ feel comfortable leaving the house at that time in the dark.  My dad is very weird. He tells me to stop dressing like a black woman ??? and that i am just a teenager with issues. He says i need to stop wearing short sleeves in the house- and just today I wore a long sleeved, loose dress but it wasn__ enough. He also spits on me which bothers me but my mom says I__ crazy.  Be honest, so many people in my family call me dumb and unladylike like __eenage girls_ today but lam I? At first I didn__ but now I__ thinking that there__ no way my entire family would say that if it was false.   Oh and one more less important thing. My mom goes bonkers when I leave my hair down even in my room. It__ medium-length, wavy, and I brush it- but she insists on a tight ponytail. My hair is delicate so it would hurt. She said she didn__ like the way my pfp on social media looked, bc it was too inappropriate when I__ just staring right at the camera- my hair down ofc. Is it wrong to leave my hair down? Ty if ur reading this. But be honest, please. I wanted to post this even tho it__ TMI. I just want an outlet."

physical,I am a 14 (f) and I think I might be with an abusive parent/dysfunctional household.,"My dad is 58 and my mother is 49, and my mother yells at me constantly to clean my room, to the point where the first thing she says to me is __lean your room, you pig/slob/lazy person_. She has yelled at me almost everyday for this, and I honestly think half of my anxiety issues about failure, self esteem, and self loathing come from her. She sounds almost identical to the bully inside my head and I__ just so confused. I try to understand and empathize with her but I cannot accept her yelling at me like this when I__ doing good with school and being independent. My mother is mentally unstable (has major unresolved childhood trauma: generational trauma is involved, has been diagnosed with depression decades ago, and shows major signs of OCD/PTSD). will leave for hours/days on end without telling anyone and will absolutely go insane if something is not clean. She almost killed my pet bird because he kept spitting his seed shells on the floor (that__ natural what they do tho). When she is stressed at work, her coping mechanism is to yell at us, through out bowls, pots, pans, toys, wine, food, anything we don__ use everyday and throw perfectly fine things in the object. She HAS to clean everyday or else she releases insults to anyone who tries tell her take a rest and says __ou guys are forcing me to do this_ and passive aggressively implying that all her problems and responsibilities are because of me. In fact, I haven__ heard anyone in the house tell her what to do, she just HAS to do it and we are like __k then_. I have tried to tell my mom many times to get mental help and she refuses. I cry so many times about how my life would be better if she went to therapy, and she had yelled at me so much to the point to where if I receive comfort from a friend I will shut down and cry because it is just so so painful. I feel like I don__ deserve love, am never good enough, and no matter how hard I try to be confident whenever she yells at me it plummets. I__e gotten so used to it I don__ cry during her yelling at me or my parents arguments (which often get physical and I have to restrain my mom/dad).   I__e experienced a situation in summer 2020 where my dad went on a drunken rage and beat up my family. It was during a time period where I was stuck between my mom and dads divorce dispute. That sparked two other traumatic events where I used sexual acts with a friend of mine as a coping mechanism and in the midst of that, got manipulated by a student on campus who pretended to be a school counselor and got really invasive and sensitive info out of me.   Today was my dads birthday and as usual, my mother starts yelling at me for not cleaning my room. I had finals week so I wasn__ in the mood of cleaning and I wanted to clean during the weekends, I didn__ try to argue with her because it made things worse and she would tell me __HIS IS A BIG DEAL, if you can__ clean your room how are you supposed to excell in anything else? I work all day everyday and this is what you give me? Can__ I just have some respect? That__ all I__ asking for, etc_. She also yelled at my younger sister (10) and younger brother (6). They became so distressed to the point where my younger brother broke down and said __om just wants us to die_ and __hy are other families doing fine and why are we not doing fine_. I true to be tough for them but inside I cry for them because it is so so heartbreaking witnessing my siblings suffering from the same pain as me. My mom then leaves the house to I guess, cool off. My dad attempts to lighten the mood and say that __oms just trying to be good for you, she can__ help herself sometimes because her job is stressful and she just wants you guys to clean_, which honestly, left a bad taste in my mouth. I just tried to comfort my siblings and we ate some food my dad bought for us for his birthday. I took a nap, and eventually I heard my mom return. She sat at her work spot and called us over for a talk. Me, my younger sister and younger brother listen to her apologize for the first sentence about her yelling insults and wants us to pity her in the next. She basically says things about how much financial debt we are in, how hard she works everyday to support us (how she can__ ever sleep, needs to clean every night, can__ stand the smell when we cook,  implying how all we need to bow the hell down to her and do everything for her), how much she has suffered over her lifetime, how our problems seem minuscule to her and how we need to suffer with her as well (which includes working yourself so hard you have no sleep and no social life). I just couldn__ stand it and felt like these were some adult things I didn__ need to hear about, and so I fiddled with a paper card, half listening to her. I felt like I was torn in half: one side was just telling me to try to understand her and the other side was wanting to rebel and saying that it felt like that time my abuser invaded my privacy.  Eventually my dad comes in, infuriated, and says to my mom loudly, __isten, these are some adults things the kids SHOULD NOT and DO NOT need to know about. They__e already helped you mop the floor and learned their lesson, how much else do you want from them? If you need to yell at someone take it out on me, you can bully me all you want but you do not insult my children_. My mothers response was anger and saying, __ take care of the kids everyday and what do you do? You sit around watching your phone and you don__ even know how to do chores. You have no right on what to tell to my children. [and she dropped the bomb] we are DIVORCED [my dads name], GET THE HELL OUT!_   All hell broke loose and they began arguing like crazy. My mother was basically saying she was right and ALWAYS right and that the children should know how hard she works and how much she has suffered. My dad disagrees and starts yelling, becoming so frustrated he says __his is emotional abuse, the children don__ ******* deserve this!_ My mom starts threatening my dad to hit her, pointing at her face, my siblings were crying downstairs earlier and now they ran upstairs in distress, yelling and screaming for my mom and dad to stop arguing. My brother collapsed on the ground and my older sister (f27) comes in, saying __top stop stop, STOP IT! There__ no need for all this, [younger brother and sisters names], please go to your room._   My mother basically said that we deserve to know and be yelled at and my dad was so emotionally upset he started stomping and half crying, saying __he children don__ deserve this, [mom__ name] WHY THE **** DO YOU DO THIS! WHY WHY WHY WHY!?_.  I was upset as well and I tried not to cry, my siblings were distressed and thought my dad might hurt them, and I told them assertively __hhh go to your rooms_. My mom then breaks down, hugging my siblings and saying __his is all my fault, I should have yelled_. And my dad cried outside saying how we didn__ deserve this treatment and that we can__ be perfect like our mom expects us to. We weren__ lazy or dumb, we were just being children. He tried to communicate to my mom, the children will grow up someday, but she yells at him and hurls him insults.   That was kind of it. I don__ know what to think and my mother is starting to look more like my abuser. I feel like she__ manipulating me, and I__ so split between seeing her as a loving mother figure and an abusive person. She compliments me on the phone and can be genuinely friendly and funny sometimes, and those were the reasons I accepted her wholly, whether I wanted to or not. I broke down saying to my older sister, why does she have to insult us when it__ her problem? If she gets therapy and a diagnosis everything will be better. My older sister says to me __he can__ be changed. I__e tried, dads tried. Just give up and accept it. You have to look at it from a problem solving stand point. If she doesn__ change, you__l have to change_.   Everything__ just really confusing right now and it__ been like this for so long. They have gone at least a long time without arguing and even if my mom yells at me I__l get over it eventually in the short term. I__ just so confused, I don__ even know what__ wrong or right anymore."
physical,I grew up in a home where domestic violence was normalized and enabled,"My dad is an abuser and has been married to my since she was 17 years old. She is now in her fifties. He has punched her, pushed, and cut her with a knife (hat is what she has said). We never had nice furniture because he would eventually destroy it in a rage he felt justified in. He has turned this abuse towards my older sister when she tried to intervene once. I remember my parents fighting and hiding behind the couch at age 5. Over the years the abuse as turn towards my older brother and myself. I am now in my thirties and have confronted my mom why she stayed and still remains with him. ( my brother who is 38 still lives with them). She said she didn__ know it was wrong. That is her excuse to this day, I cannot wrap my mind around it.  (The several times my dad destroyed my stuff when I was teenager. Once when I was a teenager at 10 pm out of nowhere and for no apparent reason. I was just glad I had a loft bed at that time.) my mom defended him saying that my room was dirty so... somehow I deserved it I guess? But, yet, she didn__ know what he was doing was wrong."
emotional,Toxic family members,"My dad is an alcoholic and my mom is a narcissistic bi polar weirdo who demands that I worship her   I am 25, out of the house, graduated college, and require small help from time to time as I am currently interviewing around and job hunting for new full time work. Anytime I try to have a relationship with my mother or update her on things she just is negative living in the past telling me how I cant do things or literally reminding me how I got fired from somewhere when I am telling her about how I made it to the 2nd round of interviews for a job that I really am excited about...   It is so draining and have nowhere to go to talk about it, its so disgusting I feel overwhelmed with head stress and anxiety sometimes. Idk why I let someone so negative affect me over and over. We have gone to therapy before where she continues her ego behavior of playing victim lying and denying and continues to act like a child never admitting to wrongs or being apologetic.   She got kicked out when she was 16 and is now a successful nurse so she thinks its okay for her to parade around telling everyone else what to do and demand to be worshipped 24/7 and always emotional blaming me for the past and bringing up random shit in conversation like a whining baby. All of this while she is re married to some jamaican guy she met and housing jamaican strangers in her downstairs portion of her house and demanding that I say thanks every 2 seconds while they are free loading and only work on their reggae music which isnt making any money...   It is her life so I don't stoop down to her level to put it down but sometimes it triggers me when she is so weird towards me and thinks its okay to put me down because she thinks it will ""motivate me"" because she knows best or something.   Something is seriously wrong mentally in her head she has had fits her whole life screaming and yelling and cant control herself and demanding everyone ask how her day was or say thanks 1000 times. Her sister has bipolar and is crazy nobody in the family talks to her and she has bitten me and drew blood from my arm once as a kid when I was trying to split them up from a physical fight when she was visiting once.   I just cant take this shit anymore its always a mistake trying to let her back into my life or talking"
physical,I feel guilty for getting a protection order,"My emergency protection order was approved yesterday. The judge said he would ""very reluctantly"" grant it. He was focusing on the fact that I waited 10 days to file. I waited so long because I had to get a good address on my ex. You can't get a protection order if the sheriff's office can't serve the person. The judge said he wouldn't typically grant it, but he also doesn't typically see facts such as mine.  I feel guilty for getting a protection order. I do think my ex is remorseful (right now - he may not be as he brews and fixates over the situation like he tends to do), and I think it's going to hurt him when he's served. I know I shouldn't care, but I do. I know that I need to protect myself as much as possible, but I can't shake this guilty feeling.  Any advice or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated!"
emotional,Need to get this shit off my chest.,"My ex (25F) and I (24F) dated for 4 years, lived together for 3.5. She broke up with me last winter, but we continued living together until April of this year because of COVID. I have mental health issues including PTSD and ADHD, which I have been in treatment for since I was 18.   In retrospect, our relationship was terribly unhealthy from the start, but I had never dated anyone before and didn't have a good model of what a healthy relationship is like. She began cheating on me early into everything and it continued throughout the relationship. Her mistreatment of me escalated over the years and eventually my ex started telling me that I was abusive to her (I've realized now through therapy that the actions, like yelling at her, that my ex held up as abusive was undeniably reactive abuse, due to me being pushed to my psychological limits by gaslighting and maltreatment). I immediately got back into therapy (I had been out of it for a year or so) and quit drinking, started medication again, really tried to fix myself.   As an abuse victim, being told I was an abuser was the most terribly painful thing I've ever heard and I loathed myself deeply for it. I swore I wouldn't let myself continue down that path. But in therapy, when I would describe the actions that my ex called abusive and my therapist would continuously tell me that she didn't think what I was describing was abusive. I insisted that I must be giving a biased retelling, and kept trying to push my ex's perspective. Eventually I left that therapist because she wasn't helping me end my ""abusive tendencies"". I returned to the therapist I had been seeing during summers/breaks from school since I was a teen. I had enough trust in her that when she also started telling me that she didn't think I was abusive, I started to question the things my ex would say to me.   Over the course of 2020 and COVID, my ex slowly became overtly abusive and it became impossible for me to deny it. But at that point, I was completely financially, socially, and emotionally dependent on her. She doubled down on telling me I was the abuser and began telling her friends as well. One day, I came home from visiting family for a day and our apartment was cleared out. She blocked me on everything and disappeared. Over the months, I've heard that she's been telling everyone she had to escape her abuser and ghosting was the only way she could get out.   Fast forward a bit, I've been dating a wonderful guy now and I've only begun to process everything that happened with my ex. The way my boyfriend treats me makes it exceedingly clear how wrong my ex's actions were, how inexcusable it all is. It's also clear that the narrative my ex spun about who I am was completely false, I'm not the insecure, desperate, manipulative, selfish bitch she made me think I was. Still, it hurts a lot to know that she's out there telling people that I was an abuser while I feel terrified to tell anyone IRL what I lived through, because she's far more popular than I am. It feels like one last bit of powerlessness, that she gets to control other's perception of me. I've already lost friends, but I've gained so many more since breaking free of her control and isolation so I don't really care about the ones who choose to believe her.   I worry for whoever she dates next, and sometimes I feel like I'm responsible for preventing anyone else from getting hurt. I have evidence of her manipulation that I gathered over the years, screenshots, audio recordings, stuff she has no idea exists. I know if she ever really tries to go after me and hurt my professional reputation, I'm covered. Right now I'm just left with the grief of knowing how much I suffered and blamed myself when I didn't have to. But a day at a time, I'm working on getting better.  Thanks for reading, it feels good to get some of this shit out of my head."

emotional,"Feel like ever since my relationship ended, I've become a meaner and more guarded person","My ex and I broke up about 9 months ago now. It was a very toxic relationship, lots of drama; gaslighting, as well as him cheating on me a multitude of times. Ever since we broke up, I've been extremely depressed as well as just shitty to be around. I lose my cool more often than I used to, I'm snarky and rude often. Man, it's tiring. I feel guilty, even like I'm playing the victim card too much. Even this is more or less just an extension of that. I look at how I used to be, and I was kinder, more caring and considerate. Now I'm just a dick.   Damn guys, I feel so alone nowadays."

emotional,How do I get my ex to stop contacting me?,"My ex and I were in a long distance relationship for about 8 months and I was very unhappy, codependent, I was manipulated, I was controlled and the majority of our relationship was built on a trauma bond. She left me a grand total of 3 times in just 3 months to get back with her ex, expressed the want to leave me many times, never gave me emotional support but always required it back, never let me have friends or let me do my own thing, and threatened to kill herself whenever I tried to break up with her. After I broke up with her she's involved me many times in her suicide attempts, consistently sent me very gorey self-harm photos after being asked not to, and baited me into being concerned for her well-being. She now regularly tries to send me messages asking to get back together, and sends me new friend requests on platforms I've blocked her on. She refuses to leave me alone.   Guaranteed she's reading this post right now, hi Irene.   Is this enough for you? Stop contacting me. I've moved on. I've found someone else that treats me the way I deserve. I want nothing to do with you and I've made that abundantly clear. You've hurt me so much in the past and you continue to hurt me by not letting go. At least paypal me the $3,000 you said you'd send me if you're not gonna stop.  Anyway.... what do I do?"
physical,How to stop answering the phone,"My ex boyfriend is currently in jail for charges I took out on him and obviously there's a no contact order in place but he still calls me. My DV advocate, the district attorney's assistant, and the police told me not to answer but I can't seem to stop myself. I'm just so obsessed with the feeling it gives me when I talk to him. He's nice now that I have charges on him and he's in jail but he still asked me when I was dropping them (because I said I was earlier). I've changed my mind since then and the DA is pushing for harsher charges because of some more things I didn't report at the time. So I'm not dropping the charges but he doesn't know and I still pick up when he calls. I know I can't have it both ways but I physically cannot stop myself from accepting his calls and I know its going to make me look bad if everything goes to trial but I have horrible impulse control with him. If I stop answering the calls he'll know somethings up and he's planning on posting bond on the 1st so if he knows I'm not dropping them and he gets out I'm worried he'll come after me. I feel stuck and I know it's my fault I keep answering the phone but I'm scared and I don't know how to stop. Any advice would be appreciated."
emotional,Withholding sex,"My ex boyfriend knew I really enjoyed sex and he would say he had a low sex drive. In the moment, I believed him, but in hindsight, I__ not certain it__ that straight forward. People with low sex drives can talk about sex, but he would regularly shut down if the conversation took on any sexual topics. Even if it wasn__ about us having sex and was lighthearted.  Our first month together we had the most sex we ever had, which I know is standard. But as things progressed, we had sex once a month. I was always the one asking and I was fine when he would say no. In hindsight, I think he was withholding sex, which is separate from his interest in sex. When I started giving feedback about things he did that I liked, those things would never come back again. The last few months, as I started pulling away, he finally started initiating sex. One time I asked him to discuss an incident that happened and he came to my apartment and initiated sex as soon as the discussion was over.  When we broke up he told me I only ever cared about sex. I was so confused because we had so many other things to connect over that we regularly enjoyed together. I actually felt like maybe he was talking about a prior relationship. Honestly I think the girl before me raped him, from how aggressive and unhealthy she was described to me. I just couldn__ understand. It was like all the other things I loved doing with him didn__ matter.  I__e never dealt with any sort of sexual trauma, I realize I__ very fortunate. I don__ have a label for what this experience was but it did make me feel guilty for asking for sex. It lead me to believe that my interest in sex was a turn off for men. People always joke that men only think about having sex all the time and after feeling so starved, I wish I could find that. I felt left alone. I felt like he used my desire against me. I don__ know what to call this."
physical,How do you deal with the shaming and victim blaming?,"My ex is now detained with a 2.5 million dollar bail, our local DA understands that his release on bail would be detrimental to my safety which is why it__ so high.  Thursday nights are typically the nights my 13 month old will stay with his parents overnight as I work and won__ make it back in time for my ex to leave for work (now he__ gone anyway). Since he was arrested yesterday, they have put up walls towards me and even texted me last night telling me they wouldn__ take their own granddaughter anymore. Wth!?  Needless to say, I got the classic __hy didn__ you just leave? It didn__ need to come like this._ __ou need to move out quickly._ __ou were just talking about going away as a family!_ Zero attempts to understand where the f I__ coming from and why I had him arrested. They will, without a doubt, get him the best lawyer money can buy for his now 4 or 5th new charge in the last two years.   Mind you, I was VERY close with these people. They had asked me before that if something happens, go to them not the police. I__e done that and they blame me for __oing back._ Is there any reasoning to get these people to realize IM NOT THE BAD GUY?! I am so hurt, especially for my daughter who adores them."
physical,Pressing Charges,My ex is still terrorizing other girls even in treatment. I am infuriated and so upset that even in rehab he is hurting others. I will be charging him with third degree domestic violence but what else can I charge him for? I want him put away for as long as possible. It__ unbelievable that even in rehab he is managing to hurt others. I had someone reach out to me and she is also going to be pressing charges. I can__ believe that he has the audacity to harm more people. Any advice on what I can do? I have already started talking to a lawyer and the YWCA. I just want him put away for as long as possible. He is a threat to society and others even when in treatment.
emotional,how to do stop trying to fix a __rauma bonded relationship_,My ex left me on the cusp of what I__ like to say was the worst day of this year. I was traumatized. We dated for 9 years and we did go back and forth a lot. I am rn consistently in touch with my therapist and I feel like my brain is dry and hungry for some closure. I literally feel like I came out of a high of this highly lethal dosage of drugs that I cannot stop sniffing out of. He has me blocked everywhere you can message but not fb and Snapchat. I go through roller coast of emotions every single min of the day. I just want it all to stop. I am this close into wanting to beg him back for forgiveness for betraying me or end myself.
emotional,"After years of being told I was annoying/immature and other insults by my ex, I still feel like I__ a burden and my friends don__ like me even though I have no reason to think this","My ex used to say a lot of nasty things to me. As stated above he__ call me annoying- even though I told him that was a trigger word for me- and immature. He would always just rip on me and never uplift me. I had to beg compliments out of him, while also being told __ don__ have to compliment you because you already know it_.   I think a lot of my social fears/anxiety came from when I would drink with him and his friends. He__ never do a good job at introducing me and would pretty much just expect me to get along with them immediately. I__ tell him I have really bad anxiety and he__ toll his eyes and tell me to get over it. Well when we would drink, I would drink like a lot and get blackout and say stupid stuff. One time I cried about how it hurt still that he cheated on me, another time I was going on a rant about about a movie, another time I was just minding my own business and his friend began to attack me with verbal insults about how he didn__ like me, I was too pessimistic, I was annoying and his girlfriend was prettier than me....My ex agreed with his friend and didn__ defend me at all. Hell he excused this behavior as his friend being too drunk and not knowing how to talk to girls....  Ever since then, I feel like super hyper aware of what I__ doing. And it sucks. I__e gotten better where I can__ relax and have fun and not worry as much. But I always have those creeping thoughts of if my friends actually like me or if they think I__ annoying. I don__ like feeling this way. Like I know if they didn__ like me, we wouldn__ text everyday or hang out at all. I just can__ help but feel like I__ a burden due to all the things my ex would say.   And it makes me feel even more nervous about drinking around new people or meeting new people too. I feel like that annoying little girl he always told me I was. But it__ like when I meet new people, a lot of the time they ask for my snap/insta/number and tell me we should hang sometime and It__ like dude they wouldn__ have asked for your info if you weren__ this really likable person who was easy to talk to. It__ just really hard to break out of this mindset :( I feel like I__e been growing in so many ways since my breakup and becoming a person I love but the bad things he said still have this strong affect on me.   Recovery is a hard process but I__ trying to get there !"
physical,He was the abuser but I ended up in jail,"My ex was 26 (M) and I am 23 (M). I'll make it as short as possible. My ex cheated on me and blamed me for not being a soft spoken like the guy he cheated with. He also threatened to call the police on me when I tried to grab my phone from home. No violence. I forgave him because he was crying that his journey as an adoptee from a different country made him cheat.  2 months later, we moved in together to a new state because I got a job offer that pays nearly 6 figures. He applied for a teacher position and got it as well.  He would yell and hit me whenever he's mad. We went to seek a car for me. He pressured me into buying a car, which I take responsibility because it's my money and I was that one who was okay with it.. At that time, I only had a driver's permit, not license. It was my first time buying a car, and I do not know anything about it. The car has high mileage so I went to return it the next day but couldn't. My ex and I argued because we couldn't return the car, and he threatened to get out of the car so he could call the police on me that I was driving without someone's without a license. He cursed and said he hoped I crash and die. Then I said "" Do you want to die with me or what?"" because I was angry. When I stopped on a red light, he got off the car and grabbed all the papers for my car and called the police on me. I parked my car on a public parking and took an uber home. I was later arrested for domestic abuse.   The charge was dropped the next day. My ex picked me up and gave me 2 options (1) stay with him and enroll in an anger management program (2) pack my stuff and he will find ways to arrest me.  The arrest traumatized me so I left. Then he filed a restraining order against me. He lied on the restraining order that I was suicidal and speeding so I could crash the car. I didn't have anyone in this new state so I rented a hotel for 2 weeks until I found a new apartment. I lost 2k for the hotel rent. I rented that hotel because it's close to my workplace and public transportation sucks. I lost 2k to pay my lawyer to handle removing me from my old lease. I used another 2k to rent and deposit for my new apartment. Basically, I lost 6k which is A LOT for me because I grew up below federal poverty level. I went to get my stuff from my place with my ex, and he hid some of the things I bought. Most furnitures belong to me. He kept many things I bought, so I basically lost 2k worth of household items.   I have accepted that I do not ever want to affiliate myself with this man. I have been seeking therapy to move on. However, I'm still hurt. What should I do to move on?"
emotional,Why do I suddenly miss them?,"My ex was abusive in pretty much every way at some point over our 6 years together. I wanted out for a long time but stayed because of guilt, suicide threats, and some sort of love. We officially split in August. A few weeks ago we met up and it was awful. I ended up calling the cops on them, which now I__ wondering if that was even necessary. (They weren__ letting me leave/close my car door and I was really scared because our last fight was physical)  I blocked them everywhere and have been so good. All if the sudden I__ kind of overwhelmed with emotions? I miss them so much and just want to talk to them. Want to start over and make things right. Why do I still love them? :/"
physical,How can I sexually relax around men again?,"My ex was emotionally abusive, and occasionally physically and sexually.  He didn't care about causing me pain when we had sex. There was a time when I had horrendous thrush and he still wanted sex. I had a bad fall and fucked up my back and neck, and he still wanted sex. He would put me into positions that hurt, and my vagina would tear often. He was obsessed with anal and kept wanting to try it eventhough I hated it and it made me bleed. I got so used to pain during sex that I think it has had a traumatic impact on me. I stopped being able to orgasm from PIV, I had to stimulate my clit every time just to feel something. I thought I couldn't squirt anymore, but it turns out that my body hated him so much that I just couldn't relax and get wet.  I've started dating men again, and I've found that I can squirt, but its not often and to be honest I need to have taken drugs to be able to relax enough. I find it extremely hard to orgasm through PIV, and sometimes I still tear and find it hard to get wet.  I know that needing lube and not orgasming from PIV sex is normal for a lot of women, but I know for a fact that its not normal for me because before I was abused my body was able to do this.  I've been seeing a really nice man, who is gentle with me and cares about my enjoyment, but I haven't had the guts to disclose the abuse I suffered to him yet. I don't want him to think that he's not skilled enough but I want him to know what's happened to me, sometimes. Its taken me a long time to come to terms with the fact that my body is subconsciously expecting pain when it comes to sex.   How can I get over this? Can anyone in a similar situation offer some advice? And should I tell my new sex partner?"

physical,"Struggling bad ever since he got out, how do I get back on track?","My ex was let out of jail a month ago to go to his court appointed rehab.   While he was in jail (7 months), I made some real serious improvements in my life. Not to say there weren__ some days peppered in where I drank too much, or couldn__ get out of bed because I was depressed or couldn__ leave the house because of anxiety. But overall, I had cut out all the other toxic people in my life (and the drugs that went along with that group), made my creative outlets, health and fitness huge priorities. Was feeling hopeful and like I was beginning to bloom again.  Then I got the news that he was release-able and waiting for a bed to open up. And gradually I just had less and less energy to be active outside of my job, have struggled to even preform the bare minimum duties at my job. Neglecting my health, activity and art went along with that. In just 2 months I__ honestly completely apathetic towards the goals I had. I basically only put effort into my hygiene and barely function for work. Weekends I__ off I can__ make myself do anything productive towards what I thought I wanted for myself. Now I just don__ care. He__ not even here to prevent me from living life and I__ living like he is here no time and energy for chores, for my art, for my appearance, no posting on social media, barely any social life.  I am in therapy with a trained therapist who specializes in trauma and dv. I make good money, have a roof over my head, I have everything to help me move past this but there__ something wrong with me that__ keeping me here. He took that missing piece away from me years ago. I started to build it back. Then he gets out and the little I built back was taken away again, and now I don__ even have the energy to desperately want it back. Logically I know it__ silly and all in my head, but my body just won__ get on board. I don__ know how to help myself, I feel bad for my therapist and feel like a lost cause.it doesn__ make any sense to me why I can__ just do this and get through it."
physical,"My ex that almost killed me about 10 years ago died last year. People tell me I should be relieved, but I'm still angry and confused","My ex was physically, sexually, emotionally, and psychologically abusive for months before he tried to kill me. After I left my support system, I knew it was inevitable to some degree.   I was struggling with suicidal tendencies/ideation, past abuse and untreated PTSD before I met him. So there was some part of me that was hoping he would kill me one day. Even after the incident and I started a new life from scratch, there was always a fear and almost hope that he would kill me or that I would have an opportunity for revenge. Needless to say, that never happened.  He died in his sleep about a year ago. It's still weird to me. On one hand, the only other person that knows what happened to me that day is now dead. On another, I'm angry that he got the easy way out.   My case never went to trial, he got a slap on the wrist, and I got any sense of closure. I've talked to my new therapist about this but every now and again the feelings return.   I'm not sure if I'm just crazy or if someone else can relate. I know I should be relieved but I feel like I was robbed of closure, justice, and, frankly, revenge. I'm angry and confused.   **TLDR;** My abusive ex tried to kill me 10 years ago and he died last year in his sleep. I feel crazy for feeling anger instead of relief."
physical,Abuser (ex) contesting restraining order,"My exbf was physically (and verbally/emotionally) abusive to me and our toddler. It finally escalated him threatening and preparing to kill all three of us, so I fled with our son to my home state earlier this year and went no contact. The police in both states have been supportive and helpful.  He showed up one day, traveling 3,000 miles to the undisclosed location we were hiding at. Cops took it very seriously and basically booted him out of the state. I was granted a very intense restraining order protecting me and my son from him. They even put extra firearms measures in place that I did not request because of the __igh level of lethality._   Today I received notice that he is contesting the restraining order. I have an attorney experienced in domestic abuse.   I don__ know what to expect, aside from the court proceeding basics I__e read about online. I__ concerned about losing some of the protections of my restraining order. I__ concerned about him going crazy, or saying I am crazy or a liar. I guess I__ just looking for support from others who__e been through this part."
physical,Escaped Abuse A Decade Ago. Just Re-triggered Myself.,"My father abused my mother, younger brother, and myself. This culminated in him strangling me, which prompted us to move out. I often felt responsible for my mother and brother, and tend to be very hypervigilant - am 26 and have only dated a few times because I__ so worried about putting my trust in someone, only for them to turn out like my dad. I still have nightmares and always feel like I__ waiting for the other shoe to drop.   I usually avoid topics like rape and DV when reading fiction, but recently read a story that I knew would contain themes of domestic violence. I thought I was far along enough in my recovery to handle it, but the depiction of coercive control, physical violence, and the POV character__ fear  (the feeling of being trapped in a hopeless situation with no escape) were honestly haunting to me, and put me in a really bad place for a few days. I can__ stop thinking about it.  It sucks to know that I have these vulnerabilities, even years later."
physical,Save my mother from domestic violence and brutality,"My father has been brutally torturing my mother in all ways, including physically for years and we kept silent because we don't have funds to support my fees for education.

physical,"My (f24) fianc_© (m24), together almost 8 years, hit me for the first time and I have no idea what to do","My fianc_© and I had been together for 7 years before he proposed in December and will be upcoming 8 years in January. He has always had some issues that steam from his childhood but it had never gotten to this point of violence. We were in the process of figure out if he has adhd so we can start that process of learning and figuring out therapy for him to talk about his issues. He has never been a violent person and has only started showing his anger in 2020, which was a year that brought out the worst in a lot of people. For some background, he was going through a lot and coming to terms that he didn__ have a stable parental figure growing up and was trying to confront his mom about these issues. He has been trying to work on himself and his past since that point. Today we had an fight that I had started because we had an argument before breakfast that turned into a three hour silent treatment, which was extremely unusual for us. I decided to confront him about why was he upset and decided to act that way. I was aggressive and pushed his buttons because at that point I was frustrated with his behavior. The argument escalated to the point where he felt it was time to pack his things. As soon as he got up, I tried to fight him about why he felt the need to pack all of a sudden and he ended up pushing me down on the bed and struck me twice in the chest. It was enough to sting and scare me in the moment but no bruises or marks. I was thrown off and in shock. He then said that it was over and had to leave because of what he did. When things cooled down enough for us to have a civil conversation before he left he was upset and hurt that he did that and had no idea what came over him. He said in the end the argument we had made him upset because it made a lot of small things he didn__ like about us build up and come out at once. He said he was leaving to work on himself as a person and to improve his mental health and that he knows what he did was extreme and that I deserve better. It__ extremely hard to come to terms with any of this because I was always willing to help him through these tough times he was going through and have helped him multiple times in the past. He said he felt like he needed to do all this alone so he knew he was doing all this for himself and not for someone else. To an extent I do understand where he__ coming from but everything that happened was so unexpected that I don__ know what to do. I want to go back to him and try and talk things out but because of how he hit me I don__ know how to feel. He said he wants the best for me and loves me which is why he had to leave but is this really the path we have to go down and break off an 8 year relationship? I__ absolutely heartbroken at everything that happened today and devasted that this might be it for us.   TL;DR! My fianc_© of 8 years hit me for the first time today due to a small argument that escalated. We broke up because he wants to work on his mental health and problems on his own because he said I deserve better than him, even though I__e always been willing to support him through his struggles. I want to go and make up and talk it out but because of this sudden act out of emotional anger I don__ know what to do or how to feel."
emotional,I__ so tired...,"My fianc_© is a hardcore germaphobe. And this pandemic has activated it hardcore inside of her. I understand. I do. She is in the high risk category. Multiple issues could be further complicated by covid. So note, in this story, I understand. But it still hurts me. And because I work with the public, it__ made things worse.   For the first 6 months of so of the pandemic, she moved out of our room into our spare, had sequestered me to the opposite side of the living room far away from her and forced to sit in a hard chair and eat with plastic utensils and paper plates. I couldn__ do anything for myself. I want water? I have to ask for it. I want seconds? I have to ask for it. I need laundry done? She has to do it. Pet the dog? Nope. Not allowed. Watch a movie? She has to get the disc. It__ been hard on her for sure, doing everything around the house, but as someone who HATES asking for someone else to do something for them, it__ demeaning.   After 6 months of this, she bought me a camping chair so I could sit a little closer and be a little more comfortable. Awesome! A little better.   Fast forward to today... we both have been fully vaccinated. We have waited the 2 weeks for it to take effect. We are good to go, right? Things can go back to normal? Right? No. I can do a little more around the house, but she hasn__ given clear guidelines and rules... so I don__ even know how to follow... I have to continue to ask for things, do things, eat things, ask for permission to pet the dog......   I hate all of this... I haven__ had human contact of any kind (except once or twice by my therapist, while doing riki/energy sharing therapy) but nothing from her. Besides the occasional poke once every 6 months.   She makes me feel like I, myself, am the virus. And I feel so small, and incomplete and not in control. I feel helpless.   Compound all of this with recently being diagnosed bipolar, and her not really knowing how to deal, or caring to be honest.   My therapist and I have decided it__ probably time to move on from the relationship. But after 14 years, my heart hurts at the thought. I hate my life. I hate everything."
emotional,I am an emotional abuser.,"My girlfriend of four and a half years finally left me. I was emotionally and verbally abusive towards her. Ever since the breakup in June, I have been going through hell and high waters to fix who I am and who I have become. Despite never truly wanting to hurt her, I did. I cannot forgive myself for what I have done to her; despite being told not to contact her by herself and my friends who are helping me go down a path of self-improvement, I have attempted contact multiple times. The guilt and pain I feel for what I did to her keeps me up at night, and I truly don__ know how to fix myself. A few days after the breakup, I got a therapist and I__e been working with him since then. He told me that I am following the patterns taught to me by my own abusive parents. I trust his words and I truly do want to heal, but the pain that I have caused her haunts me."
physical,Its officially 11 years since I left my crazy abusive girlfriend,"My girlfriend was crazy, like insane. It started off good, I was happy with her but then she started to control me, constantly lolling through my texts and sometimes not letting me see my friends. When I told her we need to split up she got *really* insane. She started hitting and kicking and throwing things at me whenever she got angry  I told my school about it but all they said was ""everyone goes through a rough spot in a relationship"" and nothing was done about it. She found out about this and told me if I dared tell anyone she'd kill herself. I was living in a hell, no one listened to me and the abuse continued. But then one day I had enough I kicked her out for good. But she kept on coming back often in the night banging and screaming on the front door. Whenever I called the police she had ran off before they got there. But eventually she was arrested on an unrelated charge.   That was 11 years ago. And I'm now living happily with my new girlfriend and a 4 year old son and I've not looked back since. I just hope that she's gotten the help she needs because she was definitely not 100% in the head."
physical,Help and advise request from this situation,"My heart goes more heavier and heavier every day. Currently, I am in the situation of totally lost for my future and my son. I am 31 with 7 yr old son and he is 26. We got married in 2019, he took me here with K1 Visa. But we are of the same nationality. Long story short, after I moved here I started to know him that he is so sensitive, short-tempered, immature, and treated me very poorly earlier in our marriage. He likes to control me financially and didn't patient with me when I was really need his help for example, when I was in the clinic to see the physician or at the office. I was so anxious and so scared. English is my secondary language. I am not good enough to speak English and I feel anxious when I communicate with strangers. But he doesn't seem to like it or impress it or help it. He didn't abuse me physically but mentally he did a lot to me. He didn't help me to get a job. I had to make myself for a living to support my son. He didn't introduce me with his family since I moved here and got married until now because I was a single mother. Lucky, I didn't bring my son because I felt in my guts like these things are going to happen. He said he loves me but he didn't show his love, generosity to support my son. He doesn't seem to let his family and relatives to know about his lawfully wedded wife and her son for the rest of his life. I know I can't rely on my whole life to this man in the future or now. He doesn't seem to deserve my love and my devotion. Right now, my country is in the crisis of military dictatorship and civil war. I can't go back to my country until those crises end. I am trying to take my son here. He is now living with my parents back there in my country. But I am so hesitant to bring my son in the same house with him. How can I get away from this situation kindly please advise me? I just want to live my life independently with my son on our own. But he cut me the chain in my neck like he's the only one rescuer for me and my son and I have to grateful for him the rest of my life."
emotional,"This always makes me question, WHAT just happened??","My husband and I have started a keto diet together, have been walking together, things have been calm around the house, very laid back. Nice, no fighting. This evening we were watching a movie and eating dinner and I said, ""what's wrong with her?"", referring to the girl in the movie.  He said,  I don't know but the tone sounded aggressive so I looked at him to assess the situation, read his body language, etc and then I turned back to watching the movie and he flipped out on me. Out of nowhere. So I explained why I looked at him and said it was no big deal and he started escalating things, saying it's never a big deal when you do something wrong. I'm not sure what I did wrong. I explained why and shrugged it off. He has made such a big deal over it and I finally told him to grow up and stop letting such little things cause such big issues. Then he went outside to get away from me. As he was leaving, I said, you're only like this when you drink. We haven't been drinking bc of keto but we decided to have a drink with dinner. He got his glass, put it near my face so I could see it and said, ""I haven't even finished my whole drink, bitch"". Then he walks out back. Usually when he gets like this he either stays away from me all night and pretends I don't exist and sleeps in another room, or explodes in anger and threatens to leave the whole marriage.  Rarely, does he ever regulate and communicate in a civil manner after this. It's causes so much anxiety on my end because normal people don't act like this. It's like he got mad because I looked at him with big eyes. My eyes are big because I have no idea what to expect and I'm just trying to see if there are any other clues that you are about to go on a rage attack.  But I also gave him an explanation why I looked at him. I feel like he's 5 years old saying, ""she looked at me funny"" and then walked outside to sulk.  But NOTHING happened to cause THIS HUGE of a reaction. I asked him later if wanted to go walk with me and he said, ""nope"".  The whole entire night is now all about this."
physical,Is grabbing something you have and wrenching it away from you abuse?,"My husband has grabbed bowls of food I'm holding and thrown it across the room. He also has pinned one arm down and leaned over me, ripping the remote out of my other hand because he didn't want me watching TV. He then hid the remote from me so I couldn't watch TV.  He doesn't think these things are abusive, but they are right? Can you help me articulate why?"
emotional,Anyone dealt with a husband in psychosis?,"My husband has had two major psychotic episodes this year. This last one he threatened to hit me and destroyed a lot of property. I know this illness of his makes him to things he wouldn__ normally do, but it__ hard to get the images out of my head. He has been medicated for a month now and is going to his appointments. I haven__ decided if I should go back or not. We have two kids who love their dad and miss home. I don__ know what I__ looking for because either decision is hard. All the what if__. Has anyone else been through this?"
physical,Not sure what to do,"My husband r\*ped me a few years ago and has been emotionally abusing and manipulating me since then. A few months ago I entered a polyamorous relationship with my now girlfriend. My husband consented and supported this. Now she lives with us and my husband and I have officially separated. I want a divorce and most of the custody of our child but I'm disabled and unemployed. My girlfriend is also unemployed due to covid. My husband has a job but is irresponsible with money so he doesn't have any and is constantly behind on bills. I don't feel safe here. I worry about my safety and as much as I don't think he would ever hurt our son, I worry about it. I don't know what to do. I don't want to live in the same house as him but neither of us have the means to move out. I'm scared to file for divorce because I worry if I do that without a safe alternate housing option I could be thrown out and lose my baby. I'm scared, I need help. What do I do?"
physical,What do you consider domestic violence?,"My husband will say that he__ never hit me when I confronted him about his anger issues. He was almost defensive and I just feel like any hands on me in anger is violence. I hate how he makes these things that are so huge to me, feel so small."
physical,Do PFAs get served on weekends?,"My little sister worked up the courage to file for a PFA on her abusive parter. It was granted just yesterday (a Friday). It needs to be served to him before it__ valid, and he has messaged her a few times this morning. We are assuming he has not been served yet, and the police department is closed so we can__ call to check the status of service. I  am guessing that it varies state to state, but is there a chance anyone here generally knows if their process is halted until Monday? OR is there a place that we can call to find the information? Any advice is appreciated, sorry if it__ a stupid question!"
emotional,My mom__ boyfriend is emotionally abusive towards both of us.,"My mom and her boyfriend have been together for 9 years now and it__ been quite rocky. Sadly their relationship started when I was a young girl so I grew up witnessing their fights and it has definitely left scars on me. As soon as I turned into a teenager, he__ pick on me every single time they__ fight. He constantly talks about my weight, my mental illnesses such as depression and social anxiety. He claims I use my mental health issues as an __xcuse_ for a lot of things. He yells a lot, to the point where I begin to shake. She slams doors and says hurtful things. He__ obsessed with my love life aswell for some odd reason. Makes fun of the fact that I__ still a virgin at 19 and I__ constantly indoors which is my safe bubble. I want to move out so bad but sadly I do not have enough money to do so. It__ so hard and my stomach hurts whenever he gets loud or I feel as though I did something wrong. He does drink but he__ so used to alcohol that I don__ think it makes him drunk. He definitely has issues he won__ admit to. It just sucks because some days he__ okay, he buys me things and also rarely apologizes. It__ a whole mind fuck. My mom does get involved, she does speak her mind and tell him to back off but when when he leaves, she brings him right back and doesn__ tend to my needs. She doesn__ comfort me. I feel trapped and alone. I know that if I tell somebody like a family member, I__l get in trouble with my mom. She doesn__ like other people getting involved. And honestly, I wouldn__ feel too comfortable telling other people either. But here, I am anonymous. Does anyone have an idea on how to cope with these things? Atleast until I can move away. I__ constantly in my bedroom and I don__ feel comfortable even eating when he__ here. I__e had enough."
emotional,I can't get out and I want to runaway,"My mom has a track record of mentally abusing me. By getting me a size 0 dress form with the unspoken message ""You should lose weight"" to telling me my brother is better at me in everything when he can't even read (He's older).   A few months ago my brother didn't feed the birds for 3 days (He said he did to me but never to my mom and it was his chore). We both got in trouble and weren't allowed to eat for 3 days. My brother had a secret stash of food, but I didn't. They wanted to trash my room to look for any food I was hiding (but I ran out the day before), in the end they didn't. I puked on day 2, so we got stale bread and chicken broth. My mom said she heard me puke then asked ""Was there any food chunks in it?"". I felt like shit for the whole 3 days and my brother faked it.  I keep a stash of food because I eat lunch late but sometimes when I go out there my stepdad is there and says ""Don't open the fucking fridge, you should've eaten 2 hours ago like a normal person."" I've just started to hate the appearance of food almost entirely.   Today I didn't get water out to the birds for 3 hours, I was the only one in trouble. My mom woke me up early in the morning and I told her my body hurt from dragging trees the other day, she didn't care.  Long story short. She said she would think about feeding me tomorrow and I have to bucket haul 80 pounds of water (2 5 gal buckets) up hill for a week.   I've thought so much about this and I just want out. No matter how. By my father, death, or running away. I've been isolated from society since covid and no longer have any friends. (She deleted their contacts and smashed my phone. I'm on my laptop that gets taken away on Friday). So I can't even go to a friends like someone suggested for my other friend. (She's 15, I'm 17. She thankfully managed to go live with her father but I'm stuck with my mother. Haven't talked to her for a while, I think I was used) I want to run away to go live with my father or my boyfriend, but I don't know how. I'm 7 miles out of town and it would be hard to leave unnoticed."
emotional,Rant,"My mom has terminal cancer, and is nearing the end of her life. Both my parents are hoarders and their house is filthy. I've just recently seen it after 10+ years. Despite my mom dying, my (and my sisters) yearlong pleas to help clean have fallen on deaf ears. My mom NEEDS hospice care, and has for a while, but Medicare only pays for in home hospice and inpatient hospice would be $2000 a month (I offered to pay that, despite my parents continual irresponsibility with money. Combined, they get about $5000 a month, but piss it away to nothing.) ANYWAY, I didn't talk to them regularly for quite some time before this. Now, because my mom is sick I talk to my dad more frequently...a couple times a day. Again, trying to help them in any way I can. I've taken A LOT of emotional torment from my dad and I've been ok, for the most part. But, today, for whatever reason, I lost my shit. I called him to tell him I was going to call the hospice nurse and ask questions about getting admitted, etc., and if he have any questions he wanted me to ask. I was going to tell him about how nice the woman was on the phone, but he wouldn't let me get that far. He just wants to assume what I'm going to say, and get mad at me for that...which was in his own head. Then he calls me an asshole, for the 50 millionth time. I slammed my hand down on the table repeatedly and say he is NOT going to talk to me that way anymore, blah, blah, blah. Then this mo-fo, tells me he is going to get an injunction against me. First of all, I wish a bitch would. Their house is horrendous. (Social services was called as they had to call an ambulance for my mom, but nothing came of it). AND, they need me to pay for my moms hospice. My dad has repeatedly told me he doesn't want to be my dad anymore, that he appreciates my help but he doesn't like me, that I'm not worth a shit, that I am a grifter, no loyalty, he constantly tells me I'm a bad person, it goes on and on. And, doesn't include the emotional shit-show that was childhood. It also doesn't include his manipulation when I'm saying something he doesn't like, ie; ""mom really does need more medical care""...he will tell me I'm killing him and he had back pain from me and felt like, ""it was the big one"".  EVERYTHING is about him. E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G. I want to help my mom be comfortable at the end of her life, but he's created mountain after mountain, literally and figuratively...and he's soooo freaking mean. I don't even know what this rant is about other than to say don't let people treat you like shit. I mean, I have and do, but you shouldn't. __"
physical,What can I do about my mothers situation? I feel completely helpless and am scared she might die.,"My mom lives in South Africa. I live in Europe. She recently got a new boyfriend who is starting to abuse her physically and mentally. He pees on her, hits her and goes into fits of rage where he breaks her phone and tries to set the house on fire. She initially stayed with him and excused his red flags because she needed his money and car for transport. Now she called me with a swollen face and bruises. There aren__ many Programms in South Africa against domestic abuse and the police is totally useless. Normally I would tell her to lock the house completely, file a restraining order against him and wait it out until he leaves her alone. But this guy is a maniac and would try to break into her house to burn it down. And if the police is called they wouldn__ do anything.  The only way is to frighten this guy or worse.  What the hell can I do? I started a new job as of the 1st and so it would be difficult for me to fly out as I__ still in the probation period. If I have to I will. But even then what would my options be??"
emotional,I don't even know how to feel right noe,My mom told me to kill myself lastnight and then offered to get me the gun to do it with. My ability to react is just destroyed.
emotional,I realized I don__ know how to play with my kid because my parents didn__ play with me. I__ gonna do better for her. Anyone else have this happen?,"My mother emotionally disposed of us after we got old enough to talk back or disagree and just had another baby (all of us are 3 years apart). Once we weren__ baby dolls anymore, she wasn__ interested. Either that or she was hoarding children like she did pets (we had more neglected dogs, cats, birds, and reptiles than I can count in my childhood).  Our dad was an alcoholic and a stoner. He worked six days a week. When he got home he was too tired to deal with us. On his days off he started fights to disengage from the family.  Now I have a four year old and I__ struggling to know how to play with her. I__e always relied on doing end-goal things together (cooking, crafts). I get uncomfortable and nervous during imaginative play. If she spills things or makes a mess, I get flooded. It__ probably how I felt as a small kid, like my parents are gonna come scream at us.  Anyone else experience this once they became parents after having emotionally abusive and neglectful parents?"
physical,How to act wisely with a violent parent when you're an adult?,"My mother lately is being violent and even emotionally abusive. We argue a lot and it's hard to reach an agreement, because obviously we have total different personalities. Whatever, I don't want anger to consume me, neither I want to act childishly. I don't want to win because she's not my war. I wanna live peacefully with my dignity safe until we are apart. So what should I do? Im turning 19 this year btw."
physical,I want to help my neighbor but I don't know how.,"My neighbor across the street and I have a rocky relationship. She was previously married to a very nice man who was good friends with my dad. When she and him divorced, she stopped being friendly with us. Her ex-husband David told us all the details of their divorce. Her brother died and she got custody of his children, David adopted them and loved them. I saw him build an extension onto their house for them, teach them to ride bikes, build a playground. He really leaned into the dad thing. The problem was that she didn't want to be a mom. She complained that David never took her out and they never had any fun. She divorced him and he was just crushed. My dad got him to get back out there and David ended up hitting it off with her best friend. They got married and since then she has hated us. Shortly after that her own adult daughter from a previous marriage very publicly left her and sided with David and his new wife. This has left my neighbor pretty isolated. Then she met her new husband.   In the beginning it was pretty quiet at their house. Nothing special. We got a couple puppies and when they were about four months old they got out of the house and wandered across the street. She freaked out. Yelled at us about our dogs, we apologized and fixed it so the dogs wouldn't wander again. Well that night that crazy SOB waited until we turned out all our lights, then came into the yard and started yelling that he would kill our dogs. My dad happened to be outside on the porch and is old and hard of hearing. It scared him pretty bad. I went out and told him that he needed to leave if he didn't want the cops around. I know my handle makes it sound like I am a man, this is a burner account, I am a young woman. So to have my male neighbor shout at me and my elderly dad and threaten to kill my puppies, really freaked me out and I have not felt safe having him in the neighborhood. So I looked him up. The guy has been married three times before, is listed as a violent offender, and has been arrested for just about every DV offense apart from murder.   So since all this happened my Dad and I have fully leaned into being nosy. We watch their house and about once a month I check the court records to see if anything new has popped up. Since then the cops have been over there three times. She filed for divorce then took it back. She filed for a restraining order then took it back. Her brothers kids were taken from her because he hit them. He is constantly yelling and shouting and revving his car at night. Last week the cops came over and were searching the neighborhood for him. The court report states that he strangled her and then ran off when she called the cops. She still let him back in two days later.   I knew that he was beating her, and I didn't want to get involved, until he strangled her. I know that research indicates that strangulation is a major red flag in domestic violence. I don't like her, and I know that she doesn't like me. But I also know that she doesn't really have anyone. Her best friend is married to her ex-husband, her daughter is living with him. She never has people over and I would bet that he has been isolating her. I want to help her but I have no idea how. I don't know what my place is in this as a casual bystander and witness. I try to listen and keep my eyes out in case the cops should be called. I have this sinking feeling that he is going to kill her. They have been married less than a year and there are four separate domestic violence incidents on the record. I am dreading the day that I find out she is dead and that I knew this whole time how bad it was and what little I did to help stop it. So anyone, please give me some advice. How do I help her?"
emotional,Often fantasize suicide,My own family treats me like less than. Been an outcast scapegoat of the family for a while. I often wouldnt mind being dead. Living is hard..especially during the holidays. The only thing often holding me back from killin myself is how it would hurt them but m losing caring enough about that the more they hurt me. All i can say is fuck.
emotional,Everything in my dads house reminds me of the past abuse,"My parents are divorced and I live with my dad full time. My dad owns the house we as a family moved in when I was around 7. That is the age I start to have memories of the abuse. Everything happened either in this house, or in my dads old car  I can't go into the kitchen without it from time to time triggering vivid flashbacks  I can't live a ""normal"" life here, when everything reminds me of the words I had to listen to, the constant feeling of fear and being on edge.   I can't handle the door bell ringing repeatedly in a short while because that used to be the indication my mom was home  These walls scream the words and make me feel like that little scared child who thought that it was all my fault and I deserved it  I have nowhere else to go, and bc I am under 18 and have no possibility of working, and no income, I can't move away  I'm stuck in this prison of my past and I can't escape  I feel so small"
emotional,Frustrated,"My parents are emotionally abusive and it__ been this way my whole life. My dad has extreme anger issues and refuses to go to therapy for it.  It__ not all bad. 90% of the time, he__ kind, fun, intelligent and generous. About once a week, sometimes every two weeks, he blows up at something and takes it out on me or my mom. He had some really bad shit happen in his childhood. This doesn__ excuse the behaviour, at all. I could fill this subreddit up with all of the things he has said to me over the years, but I wanted to rant about what just happened, because I feel so alone and stuck.   I__ a 23F for context, I don__ have a job or any place to go and I__ worried that if I did leave he would kill himself or take it out on my mom that I was gone.   This morning I took a shower. We have one bathroom, it was early in the morning, and despite my shower only taking ten minutes, he decided to wake up within those ten minutes. I was nearing the last three minutes of my shower, washing all the soap out. I heard him complaining about it and decided to hurry the fuck up because it__ a roll of the dice whether he__ in a bad enough mood to explode over me being in the bathroom when he needs it. It has happened before. I don__ bother to dry off, quickly put my clothes on and go sit at the dining room table, expecting him to do his business so I can get back in and do other hygiene shit in peace.   He continues wandering around the house complaining and bitching about the three minutes he has to wait.   I said __h fuck off_ under my breath  Pretty big mistake.  He comes into the dining room screaming at me. __hich one of you said that shit? Which one of you said it? I__l fucking kill all of you!!_ When I told him stop screaming at me he told me I screamed at him to fuck off, (I did not, I said it quite quietly under my breath) and told me again he was going to kill me. Started jumping up and down on the floor saying ____ your father, you do not say that shit to me, I wasn__ even bitching about you being in the bathroom (lie) you make everything about yourself!_ (Like I said he has exploded at same thing before except on a larger scale)   He continues screaming at the top of his lungs, going to the stairs and screaming down to my mother __ake the fuck up!_ As loud as he can.   I tell him to stop screaming at me again, this time I start crying cause I can__ hold it in.   He tells me if I don__ like it, then I can leave.   Fine by me. I__e wanted to leave every single time he does this but my mom always begs me to stay and I__ weak.   I go downstairs, grab my favourite stuff, put it in a bag, grab my coat.   My mom is awake and upstairs at this point. When I come upstairs she__ already pleading with me to go back downstairs. I tell her I__ leaving. She panics and starts the begging, telling me she won__ go to work if I leave and that he__ going to turn it on her and it__l be worse. Tells me he__ simmered down. Great. I don__ really care at this point that she__ frantic, and he yells at me from the living room __s this my punishment Kelsey, you leaving?_  No, dumbass, you told me that if I didn__ like being screamed at, to leave. I do not in fact like being screamed at and so I am leaving.   I pack a couple more things into my bag and walk into the living room and my mom says __ou__e not leaving OP_. She has hidden my shoes. I tell her hiding my shoes isn__ going to stop me from leaving if I want to and I__l walk out barefoot.   He__ sitting there crying, telling me I don__ understand. she__ pleading with me not to leave. Telling me that if I leave he will worry and he won__ let her go to work and he__l send her out looking for me (I__ fucking TWENTY THREE) He exits the room and I tell her to give me my shoes because I__ rather not leave barefoot. She starts hitting herself in the head, tells me she__l hurt herself more if I don__ go back downstairs. Tells me it__ selfish of me to want to leave when he__ going to make it worse on her.   I give in, same as I always do. I can__ stand to see my mother hurting herself physically and she knows this. I also don__ really want to leave barefoot and I have nowhere to go.   Maybe I should have just held my tongue. I feel like it__ my fault all of this happened. I should have just went downstairs originally without mumbling under my breath. I feel very much stuck."
emotional,Is it still abuse if they do good things for you?,"My parents fill the checklist for emotional abuse very well.  They manipulate me. They raise their voices when they're angry. They cut me off socially, especially online. (I'm typing this at school, the one place they can't spy on me, and even that's taking a big risk.) They threaten to take my things away. They give me virtually no privacy--I'm not even allowed to close my bedroom doors, or they'll take them off the hinges. They guilt-trip me. They tell me I have no reason to feel sad (I have clinical depression and an anxiety disorder). They tell me I remember things wrong. The very few times I try to stand up for myself, they say things like ""I never said/did any of that. You're embellishing things.""  But at the same time, they've been so good to me. They give me food, water and shelter (although they constantly remind me that technically, that's all they're obligated to do). They spend money on games for me and my siblings to enjoy; I have an iPad that I use to draw thanks to them. (Granted, they take it away every time I do something they don't like, and I think this time it's gone for good.) I have a good education, a good neighborhood, and good relationships with my siblings. They teach me how to cook and clean and take care of myself.  Is it really abuse if they're still being proper parents?"

emotional,My parents are guilt tripping me about wanting more freedom . I__ 18 and they still want to control my every move.,"My parents have been very clear sense I turned 18 that I can__ do anything I want to such as leave my house really. They started crying when I mentioned I would be staying with my boyfriend for a short period of time and proceeded to slut shame me and make me feel awful for wanting to spend time with him.   They have been extremely verbally aggressive towards me and protective and controlling sense I was a child , now that I__ 18 I want some control of my life and doing the things I wanna do like hangout with friends and be my own person. But they keep getting defensive and barking at me when I mention doing anything that is outside of my town or even my home. It__ stressful cause a part of me still thinks they can control me even if legally they can__. I don__ know what to do about it cause I wanna live my life but I also don__ wanna start a war with them. Do I keep the peace or take control? I don__ wanna be seen as disrespectful but the constant control is to much. The only reason I even wanna leave for a few days is because of the emotional stress I have when staying home , I lock myself in room and lay around depressed all day and that__ honestly not the way I wanna live. There__ also the problem of even if I do leave , what would it be like when I come home? It__ all so much to think about. I love my parents despite everything and don__ wanna disappoint them . But at the same time I wanna take a train far far away from my little town .  Seems my parents got my life down to a science they know what college I should go to , who I can date , when I can have sex and it__ annoying! I just need advice what should I do?"
emotional,Was I abused?,"My parents were loving but the main thing that stands out from my youth was a feeling of not belonging. My parents housed and fed us and were generous, we were well off-but they also expected perfection. We would spend hours deep cleaning on weekends because our homes were often for sale and we had showings. If I got a C it was like failing. I was a very shy teen and took refuge in music, books, weird stuff, hating everything, etc. I got good grades, worked jobs, and never partied. Yet somehow wanting privacy and to be left alone left me with neither. My mom would sulk for hours over perceived wrongs / unhappiness. Somehow they were always fighting with me. From age 15 on mom would kick me out and id sleep outside. My dad would ask why I didn__ apologize but I__ done nothing wrong. He said if they got divorced it would be my fault (though he was cheating as we found out later.) They threatened to ask their friends husband who was a cop to send me to juvenile prison. I honestly cannot think of anything I did but that I was moody, had attitude, and didn__ want to be around them. I developed an eating disorder. They took the door off my room. We lived far away from the extended family / moved often so I had no real external support system.   Everyone who meets my mom loves her and she worked as a social worker and therapist for abused kids and teens. Never had patience for me, though. At 17 I went off to college. I had a breakdown there (the school sent me home on medical leave) and had to return to live with them. They had their own problems and threatened to kick me out if I didn__ start working. My sister participated in their disdain of me and hated that I was there. I did get a job, started school again, and they charged me rent. They didn__ need the money, the point was to make me feel unwelcome. my sister said I was a loser and an alcoholic after they searched my room and found a full bottle of goldschlager I__ been given as a gag gift.   There are other things.. I__e worked with a therapist who has said I was the scapegoat for family problems- but it__ hard for me to recognize what happened to me as abuse. It feels dramatic to say that. My mother__ upbringing was much worse and she was abandoned and beaten up. My situation seems ridiculous to compare even though I know it__ relative. I can__ say it hasn__ had an effect on the rest of my life, though. I__e definitely been involved with many emotionally distant, cruel, and manipulative people. Just looking for understanding I suppose by posting this on here."
emotional,I__e made up my mind but I__ scared to end it. I could use some support because I have no one to talk to about this and he is the only partner I__e ever had.,"My partner and I have been together for 6 years. Everything seemed perfect the first year - he was incredibly romantic, chivalrous, sensitive and everything I was looking for at the time. I felt so safe and comfortable around him during that time.   But when we moved into together, things changed. He was very sensitive about big and small things that I did and did not do, and slowly, little by little, I adjusted myself to accomodate him and to be the person he wanted. This slow derision of my sense of self escalated during the first physical violence he showed me - he banged his head roughly on the wall, cut himself, threw things around and threatened to kill himself while holding a knife to his head because of all the pain I was causing him, and he wanted me to film it, so I could see how much pain I brought him, because in his words, I was selfish and full of ego. Then he said I pushed his buttons, I made him into something he hated. I blamed myself, I thought, yes I__ obviously selfish, despite being absolutely stunned and confused by his behaviour having never been exposed to it before. I thought, this man is so sensitive and so troubled and I must be causing him so much pain somehow. The second incident he choked me, the third he drove violently and made me feel afraid for my life and the most recent incident he dragged me on the floor while pulling my hair. But these are the big incidents and I feel there have been many micro aggressions that have cumulatively destroyed me.   I__e seen several psychologists and counsellors during this relationship and been on several antidepressants, because he always tells me when we fight how negative I am and how much I struggle with my mental health and need help. I have never been shy to get help or be accountable for my mental health, even before I met him, because I am aware of my specific issues which I shared with him and which he has used against me during our worst arguments.  Yes I had a difficult childhood in poverty and grew up around mentally ill parents and have struggled with my self worth because of it. How could I possibly be normal?  I have spent so many nights crying my eyes out, afraid of him, afraid of what he will do. Some nights I left him to stay with friends or family because. Was afraid of him.And he would verbally torture me, and pick on my biggest insecurities and wounds. It__ funny because this same man verbally would say the kindest things to me when he was out of this state. It became an addictive cycle. I have been so emotionally dependent on this man and for this validation because I had never received male valuation before.   But now 6 years later, my self esteem is eroded. I am a shell of myself. My friends have confided while the aren__ aware of the extent of the abuse or that there has been any abuse at all, that I haven__ seemed happy in years.  I am not my authentic self around this man, but he has a very special way of making me feel empathy for him and making me feel like I have to continue enduring it and giving him chances. I__e given him so many chances.   Now he is overseas for one month and I feel the space away from him has given me air and perspective. I feel it is the perfect time to end the relationship but I am so afraid to. I know I do not have the courage to end it in person and I hate that I__ such a coward. But I realised I would be happier to spend my life alone than to live in constant fight or flight mode. He will tell me he deserves more after all the years we__e been together. And I wouldnt  want to be on the receiving end of an email breakup either. But he is highly manipulative and every time I__e come close to ending it he has swayed me back so I only envision an email as the safest way to do it. Then I could pack all my things up and relocate before he gets back. But that sounds so cruel and I__ afraid to hurt him because my father abandoned me and it scarred me for life.  I could really use some words of support or advice."
physical,Is this abuse?,"My partner and I were staying at a lake house with friends this weekend.  We got into an argent and my partner left me to go spend time with her friends instead of resolving the argument. I waited for them to return and when they didn't I packed up my bags and loaded up the car. I then went and told my sister goodbye in front of my partner, letting them know that I would be driving the 30mins home to go sleep in my bed.   My partner began to hell that I couldn't do that. She had already promised to use the van to take someone else to the airport. I was so angry that I just yelled that they could suck a dick and walked off. My partner angrily followed me across the backyard and through the house going on and on about how they needed the car. I told them to get an Uber or use another friends car. They are screwing at me as I continue to try to leave moving across the house towards the car out front.  They get outside and try to physically grab my arms to stop me from leaving. I yank free. I try to put the car key in the keyhole to the door.they slap my hand out of the way. They put their body between me and the keyhole. At this point they know they have alternatives to get their friend to the airport and change tactics yelling, ""You can't leave it's my vehicle too"". I try to physically move them to get to the key. They grab my arms and struggle with me. My fight or flight response at this point has been severely triggered. They are inches from my face screaming at me that I can't leave. I eventually start yelling as well. They are trying to stop me from exiting a clearly terrible situation I start pushing them out of the way so I can get to the keyhole. They start screaming, ""Are you pushing me right now asshole"" and get right back up in my face and continue pushing me away from the car door. I'm livid at this point, I just want to leave the situation and calm down. I push my partner so hard they fall back on the gravel and their head hits a shrub. This allows me just enough time to get in the car door and lock they door.  They try to get in a back door because they know sometimes it doesn't lock due to an electrical issue. I thanks God it's locked. My partner slams both fists into the driver's side window so hard I worry it will break and screams, ""I'll fucking divorce you asshole"". I out the keys in the ignition and carefully back out of the driveway. They follow along at the driver's side window staring me down. I make sure they aren't in the way and exit the driveway.  I know that my shoving my partner was wrong. I'm not a violent person. In our twelve years of marriage I have only shoved my partner one other time and it was a similar situation where they got between me and the exit to the room. My questions are:  1. Is this domestic abuse? 2. Does what my partner did qualify as domestic abuse? 3. This has both of us rattled. What are the best next steps?  I know that my use of violence in pushing counts as domestic violence. Please help."
emotional,Cognitive dissonance _ please give me feedback.,"My partner of 4 years broke up with me almost 2 months ago. I didn__ even realize that my relationship was emotionally abusive until weeks after. I thought something was wrong and I sensed it wasn__ a normal break up but the fog hadn__ lifted _ so this is lengthy but please be patient with me. I__e been trying to get a therapist but Kaiser__ appointments are weeks apart and I__e been unable to get support. My friends have turned out to be the kind of people who are unable to handle other people__ pain and I__e been abandoned by them too.   Please tell me if this sounds like abuse, I just need someone to validate me. I think he was a covert narc but I am not sure because I was in it for 4 years so I just can__ discern if it was me or us, or him. Or what.   Our first like 6-9 months were amazing. I swear he took notes of things that make me happy. Thinking now it seemed like he was studying me. Then we moved in together and it started with small things. I would play music during breakfast and he would say __re you really gonna play that?_ Or I would cool breakfast (like i had a million times before) and suddenly i couldn__ cook eggs, waffles are too __eavy_ etc. I stood up for myself a lot more during those days but then he would talk to me (I always felt funny like I was a child) and he would somehow make it my fault or my responsibility. He even punched a hole in a door during an argument around the end of our first year.  He would have literal tantrums when he would go visit his home town and I wouldn__ want to be left alone at night so he can go see his friend. He would tell me I__ controlling and insecure and eventually I just apologized and he would from then on always go see his friend when we visited and I would just be with his family or alone.   Second year broke up with me two years in to __ave sex with other people_ and then back peddled to try to convince me to have an open relationship. This was also during the hardest time of my life. I was in my final semester of grad school, my friend had committed suicide few months before, and my best friend and I had a falling out couple of months prior.   He constantly devalued and humiliated me with sarcasm and jokes and told me he wished I could verbally jab him in witty ways and essentially I just couldn__ take a joke. His jokes were often hurtful. He used sarcasm constantly and humor after i would express my need for affection or love or whatever. He would give me like a funny and playful version of what I wanted, but never the real thing.   He demanded constant and outrageous amounts of alone time, isolating me, making me feel lonelier and more alone than when I was single. Especially toward the end. He told me when he looked for his next partner he would filter for __ore than hotness._ He also blamed me for the whole break up and pulled out every fight we have had and every small mistake I__e ever made during the relationship. He said he was gonna find someone who can just leave him alone and go hike mountains for a month or something.   He started convincing me to get a Brazilian Butt Lift and said how he was gonna trade me a Range Rover someday for it. When I told him I didn__ want to look like that he would pout and tell me that it__ what animates him and he can__ help that he__ like that.   He wouldn__ really acknowledge my accomplishments. I got a Master__ during our relationship and said I wanted to celebrate but nothing ever came of it.  He told his family a really private thing about me right in front of me and I was so humiliated. I said something later and he apologized but it didn__ seem genuine.  His taste in movies, food, books was always __etter._ At the end if our relationship he asked me why I couldn__ be more like him, why I had to like tv shows, and why I couldn__ real more esoteric material.  He broke up with me out of nowhere and then we still lived together for 2 weeks where he would go from telling me how amazing I am, how much I__e accomplished to being super cold and angry and criticizing me. Then he would be super affectionate and loving and still tell me how we can__ be together.   It__ been almost two months now and I feel like I don__ know which was is up but in the aftermath I am anxious and depressed and although my rose colored glasses are falling down and I realize that the person I loved wasn__ really who he was _ it hurts immensely.  I don__ understand. I thought I was a strong woman, and I never told anyone about the things that went on because I always rationalized it. __e__ a good man._ __e loves me._   But I started to believe he was more intelligent, a better cook, had better taste in art, etc.  Toward the end he became obsessed about __eaving this life of mediocrity_ and __ecoming something elite._ He started talking about __eing in a room with important people because it__ terribly interesting._ He meditates and has for a long time so I thought he was a mindful person. I thought I was just not as emotionally stable as him.  Looking back now I see that I exhausted myself planning everything we ever did. I helped him through school. I took care of his animal. Like i did so much for this person who was incredibly cold to me in the end. Like ice cold. I don__ understand how I deserved this after 4 years. The break up came about because I brought up marriage and if he got into school out of state I didn__ want to leave my job and friends without a hard commitment at which time he admitted he has been thinking about breaking up for months. But he was still having sex with me, driving my car to work, and accepting everything I was giving while putting emotional distance between us. I sensed it for months. I had SO MUCH ANXIETY. And I thought it was me the whole time. The day we broke up when I brought up our issues I just spilled with anxiety.   I am ashamed too. I begged after. Offered for us to go to therapy. Me to go to therapy cuz I thought something was wrong with me. I had an abusive childhood so I blamed myself.   Please give me some feedback.  I feel like I am crazy.

emotional,How to recover?,"My partner of not very long was abusive to me this weekend, didn__ hit me. But his words sure felt like it did. I was feeling a little different on edge being around his friends again because he had publicly dumped in front of his friends which for anyone can be traumatic and humiliating. Well this weekend was even worse, he flipped out of nowhere when we talking to him and his friend. He gave me back my house key and said he can__ do this anyone with no context of why. I asked him why? What did I do wrong? Classic me questioning if I did something wrong because I didn__. I was told multiple times to shut the fuck up, kicked out of his house and when I came back to get my clothes from his draw he said go on then and fuck off. And all of a sudden he changed, crying and saying sorry I didn__ mean anything. It has almost been a week this has affect me at work, my sleep. Im having dreams about it and waking up panicking and sweating. He wants a second chance_¦â..how does anyone recover from this? I feel like hell, I__ devastated and emotionally destroyed."
physical,Anticipating Abusive Behavior from New Partner,"My previous abusive relationship was primarily verbal/psychological, with some physical instances towards the end. Most of the verbal behaviors consisted of putting me down, making me feel inadequate in various aspects of my life, and severe bodyshaming that led to moderate BDD while healing.  I finally feel comfortable to start dating again. I find myself anticipating abusive behaviors from my new partner. Despite kind words and compliments, I have a sense of dread that it will eventually turn, that maybe he is saying these kind things now but eventually he will tell me all the same horrible things my ex did.  I plan to talk through these anxieties with my therapist, but I'm curious if anyone else has experienced similar feelings when starting to date again. If so, how did you overcome these feelings? Did you communicate them with your new partner? How do you communicate these things to your new partner without being a burden to them?"
physical,Animal abuse and dv?,My recent ex admitted to abusing his cat for months. Well technically he said he would get really angry and __ishandle her._ From the gestures he made I think he was strangling her and throwing her across the room. The cat was also limping and when I pointed it out to him he played dumb for weeks before admitting that he__ grabbed her so hard once he heard her leg pop.   When we were breaking up he said he needed to end things to work on his mental health &amp; before he __oes something really asshole-ish to me._ When I asked him what that meant he didn__ elaborate but just repeated himself. Now I__ thinking he maybe was worried he might hurt me like he hurt his cat? My friends &amp; fam all tell me how good it is that I got out &amp; they seem pretty sure that this would__e escalated to violence towards me...but I have a hard time believing that.   Does anyone have any insight or comments? I__ just feeling so flustered and confused about it all.

emotional,Emotional abuse and custody - how to prove it and does it matter,"My significant other feels like they have been emotionally abused. I feel in a similar way that I have been emotionally abused. I feel that I could give many examples, and she could also. We are going through a divorce. We each have a few journal entries that explain our Viewpoint of emotional abuse but not much else... And not a ton from either side. Both our families are siding with their own side or neutral ... and neighbors are all pretty much neutral. I have recordings but more about parental alienation than real abuse directed at me. There are no abusive text messages, or emails that would indicate emotional abuse from either side. Kids and custody are involved but kids are not being emotionally abused. How much do the courts take into an impact emotional abuse when it comes to custody if it did not involve the kids? It seems nearly impossible to prove from either side. Especially if there's never been any type of other abuse from either side."
physical,Sister is being abused and I don__ know how to help.,"My sister met this man six months ago, and there were a lot of red flags right away. The first being he wanted to get married after their first date. The next being that any friends that don__ approve of him whole heartedly are kicked out of her life. He put hands on her in front of my nephew. She just called me convinced that everyone, our mother included, doesn__ love her. Now the wedding is in three weeks. A lot of her friends have dropped out after seeing his behavior. I am unable to have a conversation with her _ even on the phone _ without him there. She told me last night she wanted to kill herself. It seems she is completely convinced all her friends leaving her is because she is unloveable, and I don__ think she recognizes he is abusing and manipulating her. I don__ know how to talk to her about this. Any and all advise is welcome."
physical,I feel really weak,"My sisters friend was keep on getting teased by her colleague who was drunk, he then started to make inappropriate like ____l keep you warm_ in response to her saying ____ cold_ after that he grabbed her hand and started doing something that made her scream he stopped when she said so but I__ afraid if he didn__ stop I wouldn__ even have stood up for her.   I__ an 18 year old guy and kind of athletic but In these situations I just freeze because of overthinking, fear, and etc. whenever my dad hits my mom I just freeze and go to my room and when my sister and her boyfriend had a fight I froze this kind of thing happens when the guy is older than me, I see older guys (guys older than me by 5 or 7 years) as authority figures and people who must be respected so I_ I don__ even know what to say nothing I say is a valid excuse.   Ps. The joke would__e been alright if they were pretty close but they aren__ surely as close as they should be for him to make that joke so I__ pretty sure it wasn__ right but I might be wrong."
physical,Female abuser - Is TRO / RO helpful to make them move out ?,My spouse hasn__ been officially diagnosed but she__ certainly NPD and/or BPD. She had been abusive as soon as the day after marriage in 2007 (total flipped) but the COVID lockdowns has made her total bonkers. She__ on a mad rage daily with maybe a few hours of normal time or when she__ napping in afternoon. She pulled a knife on me (kids weren__ far away) and I have it clearly on tape.. along with all of her raging episodes with almost daily death threats etc.   My therapist is going to report it so I__ on borrowed time but I am not sure what I can expect if one of the family member (kid or myself) called 911 in the middle of her such rage. If I got a Protective Order or Restraining Order -  what does it really do - ask the abuser to leave house immediately? My therapist told me I should leave the house with kids first for safety reasons.. if I did that her already raging self will go super ballistic - she__l surely damage a lot of property and there are too many things to take with us if we wanted to go to a hotel .. and god knows for how long.. so I didn__ follow up on that suggestion. I thought there must be a way to kick her out (I__l even pay for her rent or hotel for as long as she needs to but the kids have clearly said that they want her gone and my daughter kids are only 10 and 5).. what are my best options to get this outcome?   I am trying desperately to find a lawyer in the meantime - a lawyer that knows how to handle high conflict people like her

My brother not only abused me, but continues to thrive in mysogny. He is spewing the same fucking mysogny and abuse for more generations to come.   It is particularly sad that my little cousin is hearing this shit because his father is just like my brother. He beats women, has two baby mommas, and can__ keep a steady relationship.

She was pushed so hard that she fell and fractured her foot.  She__ been gripped up and slammed against a door-so hard that she was left with bruises.  And, most recently, slapped across the face. He has a drinking problem-and this is how she has justified his behavior..__e only hits me when he is drunk._ - the slap across the face..he was sober.  He is emotionally abusive to the MAX.  He tells her __ou are mothering our daughter wrong._ __ou__e messy._ He tells her that she doesn__ have to work, so that she can stay at home with their child.  Meanwhile, its so she can__ make her own money.  He tries to control her finances.  Asks her why she gets so dressed up for work.  Screams his head off that he hates her, then tries to have sex with her.  Blames her for why he drinks, and so on and so on.  She has escaped to my house for a day or a  week at a time.-more than once.  She has a __ug-out_ bag packed and ready for her and her child in case he starts drinking again.  Currently, she is staying at our friends house because she__ afraid when he drinks-and he__ drinking.  Again.  She goes back every time.   		I am only posting because I am scared.

physical,My child__ father wants to get back together and says he__ changed but I__ not sure,"Need advice. My (29F) ex (35M) and I have a 2 year old together and I left him 3.5 months ago because he was lying to me about being on adderall and suboxone. He was getting more than his prescription and had several different strengths of the medicine in his pill bottles and he was being very verbally abusive to me. He blames the adderall. For background I had left him the year before for several months because he choked me during an argument and bc he had a habit of pushing me down or into walls while we argued and I__ get some bad bruises. I don__ want my son to witness the fighting or hear the names he calls me when he__ mad. I have family and friends who have lost their kids to CPS for being in violent relationships. He is in therapy right now and says he__ changed for the better. I__ so torn on what to believe. I can__ believe I ever let myself be in this position. He__ lied to me before a lot and he used to steal things from stores. He has a big heart and can be amazing at times. But his lying, adderal, and verbal and physical abuse has made me not love him like I used to. I__ not sure that__ something I can change... obviously he wants to be together but he__ only stopped verbally abusing me last month. On October 9th He went crazy and started calling me names over text saying stuff like he can__ believe he had a kid with me and all this stuff. He apologized the next afternoon as it was completely unprovoked. He swears he done doing that now. I want my son to have an intact family but only if he can really change...for the last 4 months I__e been supporting my son and working full time and I__e been doing ok. I__ making it. I__ afraid that if I go back to him I will have to start over. It was so hard to get him out of the house as he wouldn__ leave when I found out he had been lying to me. He minimized everything he had done at first and blamed everyone and everything else. The fact was that he had been keeping the adderall a secret from me for 3 years, been taking more than what was prescribed and was selling some of his. All illegal things that I__ not ok with. I could have gotten in trouble too. My heart is broken for my son who cries when his dad has to go. He says he loves me but he did all these things. He always called me a F&amp;!)&amp;!* Bi?!% whenever he got mad in front of our son and once even tried to teach our son to repeat him. But I__ lost y__ll. How can I move on? How can I just break all the way free? Should I? I__ so torn and I need help."
emotional,You didn't deserve it,"No siree Bob you did not deserve to be abused, mistreated, snapped on, yelled at, snarked at, gaslit, belittled, or have their flying monkeys thrown at you, or have their peanut gallery of friends and family used as backup to reinforce their statements that you're broken and need fixing.  Anyone who acts like you're too sensitive, or volatile, or problematic, who is psychologically domineering, endlessly stubborn, unemphatic, impatient, and displays callousness, is not someone with any credibility on deciding what YOU are.  If you're crying, hurting, or scared, because of something they did or said, they should care enough to try and remedy the situation and work with you towards a solution. None of this ""I'm too busy,"" crap. If they're too busy to participate in the relationship, to do the bare minimum, then off they fuck.  If they stop saying they love you, off they fuck.  If they stonewall you, off they fuck."

I never want to self diagnose, but I at least wanted to get some perspective. Here__ a bit of what I__ feeling:  Hearing or seeing about her can still spark angry outbursts/strong feelings of anxiety in me. I still have dreams about her, often revolving around her and the guy she was messing around with while we were dating. I feel like I__ in a constant revenge state and want to see nothing but bad things happen to her. When it comes to moving on, I__e tried getting on dating apps but then feel anxious to move forward with anything. I__ more self-conscious of my appearance than ever and I feel like I burden my friends when I talk to them about issues with her because they__e probably heard enough.   I know some of this stuff might be self-imposed, but I just hate it. I miss the good parts of when we were together, but she was also awful to me. Debating going back to see a professional again. Regardless, I wanted to see what experiences people had with possible PTSD. Thanks."

physical,Next steps after 911 &amp; Leaving Household after long-term domestic abuse?,"Note: this is a throwaway account just in case anything legal becomes involved. Depending on how things go, I may update this from my main account in the future.  My father (57M) has been emotionally, sexually, and to some extent physically abusive for a very, very long time to me and my mother.  Him and my mother have been together for at least two decades. A few days ago I came out as trans officially to my those around me. For more clarification I__ a trans girl, 17 turning 18 in 2 months, so still a minor. I am also the only child of the household. Was hoping to ride things out until I was 18 but that didn__ really happen.   Sunday (June 21, 2021) my father had a particularly off day (generally pissed off mood) that escalated after he took a nap, when that normally de-escalates things. I can__ tell if it__ because I came out as trans or not, it__ just a hypothesis.   After throughout the day threatening to kick me out of the house or hit me I left, and my mom (59) left with me, and I called 911. The last thing he said to my mom was __ou__e abandoning me and you gave me a gay son?_ (There__ a lot to unpack there) It made me laugh when I heard that.  So far nothing has been overall bad, but I__ not fully sure what the next best step(s) are/is.   Me and my mom were safe in a hotel for the night. My dad slept in our apartment in a comfy bed with 90% of me and my moms belongings (everything from expensive electronics to my birth certificate). The police couldn__ do anything since my dad very rarely is physically abusive, they could only suggest we speak to a lawyer. My mom is unemployed and doesn__ have unemployment.   For more info I__ in NJ, USA. I go to a boarding school, and am on scholarship, so relocation within NJ shouldn't be an issue with schooling.  Questions I can think of right now would be:  * Is it worth speaking to a pro bono/for profit lawyer? If so what kind of lawyer? Is it domestic abuse or divorce representation? My mom does not want to go to court. What can I realistically expect them to do? We tried to call two pro bono lawyers but no response as of now.  * What__ the best way to get custody of my belongings or apartment? The apartments lease is under my dads name. Also, all of our/my stuff is at our apartment. It feels unfair for the abuser to get all the stuff and get to sleep in an apartment. But just because it__ unfair I don__ know if it__ actionable. * CPS (child protective services) has yet to call, but when they do what kind of involvement would I be expecting? * Immediately and future-wise what should I do regarding this?  I can always fend for myself if need be, but I cannot do much for my mother since I__ a 17 year old in high schooler without a job. My mother is currently unemployed and unemployment hasn__ come through at all.   Thank you so much in advance for your help :)"
emotional,Domestic abuse,"Oh! He's being nice, because I'm willing to go all out. He'll play nice, he'll say its all about what I want.  He feels sick, because the truth hurts, he knows he's done wrong. He doesn't want to lose the income that shows he's done better and is better than other people. I shake, but I'm playing on the niceness and vulnerability that I once was. I have clutched at straws, I've clenched my teeth. I've seen the true face of who he is, I'm scared, but not scared enough, because I've been punched and beaten before. Well I will walk out here with my head he'll hight, because its not me, it's you, fuck you!! I'm just dealing with my affairs and a few scattered ones dashed about. I just needed a friend to know what actually happens when  nobody is around and to look deeper than the aesthetics of what you call a happy.life"
physical,Stopped a DV in progress...did I help or hurt?,"Ok so I live in a medium not so great neighborhood and this went down last night.   I work the overnight shift so I'm usually awake as last night I was off work. Around 5am there was a commotion down in the street, lots of yelling, at first I assumed random drunks, but I heard crying and some guy yelling ""I hate you!"" In between some unintelligible stuff and the other respondent yelling ""I said I was sorry!""  Initially I thought this was a father and a teenaged boy. Then the slaps started. It sounded open fist but it was still hitting so I went downstairs and out of my house and asked if everyone was okay. What it turned out to be was a man and the 8 months pregnant mother of his child. She was absolutely hysterical as you can imagine from whatever was going on in their fight so I stood between them. I asked her if she wanted a ride home and he kept yelling ""yeah, go with her! Go to your sisters house! She'll drive you!"" (Im a closeted transman but I look pretty ...lesbiany). I asked her if she'd like a ride, emplored her to come upstairs with me for a glass of water but she was really freaked out and kept backing away from me so I didn't push further. Instead I turned my attention towards him and keeping him locked in conversation. She didnt seem to want to leave but eventually started walking down the block by herself. He was holding a bottle and clearly pretty drunk. He started telling me about how freaked out he was over everything with COVID and how he was just visiting his cousin here or something and had kids in North Carolina. I did my best to sympathise with a man who repeatedly told me the woman he was smacking was 8 months pregnant with his child, even got him to give me a hug which he said ""calmed him down"" and told him to go back to his cousins house to sleep it off.   What I'm worried about is whether I could have done more to help her...I hope to god there isn't a next time but I'm worried I gave her abuser like...support? I was really just worried about separating them and deescalating. When she said she didn't want a ride, or police (they were both black, so understandably) or to sit down in my home I didn't want to force it with how scared and upset she was. Ive never been in a DV situation myself so I dont know what she needed. All I know is I had to get him to stop hitting her in that moment.  How could I be better next time?"
emotional,____,"ok so idk what i want out of this post i just need some advice ig. so my mom yells at me and so does my dad for no real reason it__ scary and they don__ apologize and my mom gaslights me and a bunch of other bad stuff but she like cuddles me right after. she says her live language is touch and she never feels bad for yelling at me and belittling me because she says it__ good parenting and important and stuff. i just feel so gross about it she touches me a lot like just randomly and then i think she__ gonna yell at me and i just don__ like it. i cant really have boundaries with her because she plays the victim and stuff. so all of this to say i have a crush on this guy and i think he might like me back idk. but i was thinking about cutesy stuff i could do with him when (manifesting __) we start dating, a good amount we can__ do because i don__ think he__ out to his school, but the thing i really was thinking about was like cuddling and holding hands and stuff. i really want to because that__ so cute and i really like him, but i__ scared if he or anyone touches me i__l start thinking about how my mom touches me and get really upset and ruin everything. idk it might be different because it__ him and not her. i might just be making up problems i don__ even know if i__l ever date him. but like when i get a boyfriend i don__ want to be so standoffish like i am with her. i__ a skittish person because i__ always scared at home but i want to be able to feel safe and be able to be held when i get a boyfriend. if anyone else had a situation like this what was your relationship with touch in romantic relationships? i want to know if i__ just overthinking a lot lol"
emotional,attachment issues?,"Okay so a little background first.. i think this all stems from my family issues so here it goes, ever since i was a kid my mom was emotionally and physically unavailable for me and my siblings. for example: she sent us away to our grandma's for a few years, was always on anti depressants so it was difficult for her to take us to school or pick us  up.. on the weekends she was always out and about.. my father during this time was out of the picture, he was an abusive alcoholic and ended up losing his whole family due to it. he's sober now 6 years but i dont really visit him because he lives in a studio. im 21 btw. but anyway.. my boyfriend that ive been with for a year now, basically took me in and i dont really see my family at all. my mom moved to Nevada the beginning of this year (we're from california) and she took my 2 youngest sisters with her. So basically left me to fend for myself. im very grateful my boyfriend lets me stay with him but oh my god is it toxic.. he drinks sometimes and when he does, he turns into a completely different person and starts to message girls ;/ , sometimes he'll play fight with me too but hes so rough and im a small person (im 4'11 hes 6ft).. ill clearly tell him hes hurting me multiple times but just laughs it off.. it sucks because i already feel traumatized from all the shit my dad and mom puts us through and then to deal with this...like he doesnt realize how much it triggers me and continues to do it DAILY.. ugh lol sorry for the long post, i know its kinda all over the place but i just needed to rant because i feel like i cant tell anyone.. all my girl friends just say im dumb and i enjoy getting hurt.. but its easier said than done to just up and leave    ugh idk what to do.. its so hard to leave especially when it feels like hes all i got.. does anybody else on the same boat? fucked up family and toxic relationship? idk what to do anymore.. i feel lost.. hopeless.. depressed.."

He was about to run an errand to kill time and when he was about to leave, he went to hug me but ended up squeezing me really hard to where it hurt pretty badly. I backed up like wtf? He apologized and said he had excess energy and he didn__ mean to hurt me.  We__e had issues with emotional abuse and we__e trying to work through it and his anger together but... that honestly kind of scared me? He__ never physically abused me before and it__ not like he grew up around that or anything but... yeah. Idk. Just wondering if this is how it starts or maybe it really was just an accident from __xcess energy_?"
physical,I hit my mother yesterday,"Our relationship has become really toxic in the past two years when she literally chose the people who were abusing me verbally, financially and physically and refused to help me when I begged her for help. She told me people will make fun of me if they get to learn that I am going to psychiatrist when I mustered up the courage to her about my depression and insomnia. She also told me how I will be a coward of I commit suicide when I told her I am suicidal.    I started resenting her after that. Although I still supported and protected her and my aunt when aunt's son would get into their faces during fights which would end up in me getting hit by him. One day my mother did something I begged her not to but she didn't listen and told my aunt's daughter something which resulted in me getting beat up again later. And I lost it, that was the first time I smacked her and after that I hit her two more times in the next 1 year.   The latest being yesterday, she made me withdraw thousands of money to help my aunt's another daughter and I lost my mind. I kept warning her that they would ask us for money and to shut them down but she didn't listen. She never listens. So I hit her. I hit her multiple times and with force this time. I slapped her and I felt to sympathy and no guilt.    But today, the sound of the impact that my punches made iwhen I was hitting her is haunting me. I keep hearing it and I want to hold her beg her for forgiveness but I also loathe her for not saving me when I needed her the most.  I went from being an abused person to an abusive person myself.  Tldr: mother didn't save me when I begged her help whilst getting abused financially, verbally and physically. Made me withdraw tons of money and i went from being an abused person to an abusive person myself."
emotional,Can I get him back?,"Our relationship was full of bloody arguments. Most of the time I was insulted, called the abusive one, called a b**** . Lots of things were said about my family and how horrible they were. Made up things to make my dad look bad. A lot of blame. And blame for him being suicidal. I finally opened up, finally got him to listen after an hour of screaming and crying about what he was doing to me, he sat and listened and if he couldn__ hear me he made sure he could understand.

The last month was honestly the best in months. I was so happy. But I then became the one who yelled, who insulted, who invalidated him. He told me he was depressed and i invalidated it and told him to stop putting it on me and see a therapist. We still had our little arguments in the last moth but it wasn__ like how it was when he was abusive. Instead him yelling at me it was me yelling at him when I hurt him. I would yell at him telling him _ you abused me for months_. I always had to be right, never wrong. I didn__ apologize, I told him he was abusive. I am aware of reactive abuse. Not really sure what it is, I joined a FB group and it__ said a lot in my posts. I regret leaving so much. It was doing so well.

When telling them that isn__ okay that they hey pushed me they said they felt I was being aggressive and bumped into them (later clarified my butt bumped into them).

I__e basically written out a load of examples of things my partner says/does that make me think I may be in an emotionally abusive relationship (if u need more context for any of these please let me know):  __hose boys only want to have sex with you, not because they actually want to be your friend._  During an argument, brings this up out of the blue - __ou__e round at the house of the man (who is one of my closest friends) who__ madly in love with you_ - when I get upset, starts shouting at me __hat even is this reaction! I can__ do anything right!_  During an argument, stands in a way I find intimidating, ask him to move __h of course, because I can__ do anything right and I__ a psycho_   Constantly avoids making decisions -eg what to have for dinner or watch on TV- Then claims that everything always has to be my way  Constantly tells me offhand that I am mean, a bitch etc __s a joke_ until I get really upset because I feel like a bad person and I__ afraid of being like my grandmother. He tells me __ou can work on it though, You can learn to be more considerate etc_  During an argument, I ask to take a breather  and he stands blocking me from leaving while we__e on the stairs. He says __o. We__e going upstairs to talk about this right now._  Later on when I brought up that this ^ made me uncomfortable, scared and intimidated, he just says- __o YOURE saying I__ a bully? but you know I would never do that_.   I tell him I was sexually assaulted by a past partner. He tells me he is sorry this happened but then immediately tells me how he doesn__ like to hear about me having sex with other men.   When I text him at regular intervals during the day telling him my plans and where I am, what time I will be home, then during an argument claims I never pick up the phone to him.   I tell him I would be more comfortable if I was the one who initiated sex. He says __ut then we would never have sex_. When I bring this up to him he responds with __h you just think I__ a big pedo rapist don__ you?_  Saying __ want you and my mum to leave me alone so I can kill myself_ often.   TL;DR- basically a list of my partners behaviour that I feel isn__ healthy. Need help figuring out if it is, and if so what do I do."
physical,Keeping a journal will save you,"Physical violence/drug abuse   I wanted to write about this days ago but I was so flustered and upset that I couldn't keep on track. So here it goes.   I (27M) left my partner (26F) of nearly 4 years about 2 weeks ago. The wound festered for years but is finally healing. From the beginning there were commitment issues that she labeled as poly/relationship anarchy. Which I have a deep understanding of yet, as a demisexual, could never pursue partners without an attachment. So I didn't.   For the first year I would strive to be the best I could as there was literally competition. I know there were tons of red flags but I was jaded. Ultimately I learned I was looking for fulfillment through affection at the time.   Fast forward nearly a year later. My partner decides monogamy is best after I find a discussed interest in a friend. Shortly after, a natural disaster leads to hardships at work and a difficulty with keeping my home. She offered to allow me to temporarily stay with her at her family home. The thought of living with someone I had only been with for nearly 8-9 months concerned me, but so did being homeless yet again. So I accepted the financial and housing terms. Her loving family gladly accepted me and eventually her father became more of a father than I ever had growing up.   Two months in, Christmas was welcoming and the atmosphere of family was something I hadn't truly had. At least not this accepting of one. But... three months into living together I discovered my partners true colors. The alcohol, cocaine, whippits, etc. Granted I was drawn into this lifestyle, it was never quite as intense as hers.   The casual drug use at social events blead into nights at home or simple outing with friends. On her half. Then it turned into something much more serious. She began to secretly consume drugs while drinking then accuse me of stealing. The first night was 3.14.18.... she had been drinking all day and went to take a bump. She came back in a furious rage. Pouring two drinks out all over me in our bed, pulling me up by the shirt and forcing me out if her room. (I was completely sober) I had to come back the morning after and clean the mess because she insisted I spilled the drink and ran off.   Things fell apart after this. Eventually, we went on a holiday city trip which ended with four hours of me searching the streets for her to only be sucker punched with a hand-in-bottle style fist. I thought that was where everything went wrong and I didn't think of much in between.   I moved out, got my own apartment and disappeared one day while she was at work. But somehow, I was convinced I was in the wrong for doing so. That I was terrible and I humane for abandoning her. We pursued the relationship yet again with goals. Yet nothing improved. The violence ensued. So did the drinking.   This had an impact on my profession, stability at home and even the emotional health of my roommate whom is absolutely amazing.   Two weeks ago I decided to confirm I was unhappy in the relationship and we needed to end. Doors were broken, things were stolen, neighbors were involved. Granted I got so upset I tried to pull something of mine from her hands and she fell to the ground. So I retreated to my room a final time.   Anyway. This is a lot of venting. But what pertains to the title the most, is keep a journal. If it weren't for the journal I kept, I wouldn't remember half the horrible things my ex had done to me. The gaslighting, the physical assault, the endangerment. Because I wanted to go back. For a while I believed, ""maybe I'm being too hard and I dont remember everything properly""."
physical,Scammer,"Please beware of a scammer who__ been exploiting people__ better natures with a fictitious story about having left her partner and needing food.   She posted in r/Bristol one evening this week, saying she was in hostel but had no food. I offered to buy her a bag of shopping but she didn__ want to meet and asked for an Asda gift card. So I bought her one. A few days later she popped up on r/Brighton with the same story. Has been active in Scotland too I believe.

physical,"Years later, everyday things still hold us hostage. It's not fair.","POSSIBLE TW'S  I am discussing my own PTSD and how it shows up in random places, But I do not want to trigger anyone else in the process. There's no direct mention of abuses but it's inferred.      I thought I'd moved on better from this last one.. but man.. my daughter just powered up the gaming console.. the beeps were identical to the digital pad from my exes gun safe. It's only been 2 years... It's thrown my day off course and I'm trying to feel it out and get back on track ..   So now I'm thinking about the everyday experience and how many things I have to be aware of, so I'm not caught off guard. Stupid everyday things one shouldn't attach to trauma.   For example.  the rich exhaust of older trucks reminds me of being forced to beg for money and gas at gas stations. It's been 9 years.   Gasoline is a similar but way more traumatic smell still, and it never even **actually** brought me harm. Just the  threat of it.  Motels make me on edge. I traveled and was poor often, my exes liked to be surrounded by questionable people.  Tailgating while on the interstate is going to give me a guaranteed panic attack if I'm a passenger, as will myself or someone else accidentally turning off the headlights at night while the car is in motion (I think only older cars allow this)  I have so many little things that I try to separate. EMDR was helpful.. I hope to find a great therapist in my new area soon. I feel for all of us just living our lives and out of nowhere our whole day changes course. I hope you are all doing well and if you're in a situation STILL where you're in danger.. please reach out to me, a friend, a family member you can trust. No one deserves this. There are ways out. The less you deal with the less you'll have heal from. So much love, friends."
physical,TW: mentions of suicide and sexual violence. Really need input. Me (18f) have been in abusive relationship with (20m) for about a year and a half. Trying to end it. ( removed from r/relationships and told to post here),"Really need input. Me (18f) have been in abusive relationship with (20m) for about a year and a half. Trying to end it.   There__ so much to write about but to keep this from droning on too long I__l attempt to keep it short and on topic.  I met my boyfriend in 2016 and instantly fell in love with him. We lost touch then in late 2018 started seeing eachother again. Our relationship was a dream. We got along so well, we had a lot of the same passions. We spent so much time together and genuinely loved eachother. In October of 2019 thins started getting odd. Out of no where my boyfriend (let__ call him James) accused me of cheating, there was absolutely no basis for him to do so but he screamed at me and demanded I open a Snapchat in front of him. I was obviously shocked so I did. There was of course nothing suspicious and he later said my __annerisms triggered him_ I still have no idea what I did.  Then things were good again for a while, until he started accusing me of being in love with an old hookup. I explained countless times that there was absolutely no feelings between us. I hadn__ spoken to him in almost a year; when we did hookup it was non romantic. My boyfriend said I talked about Him too much, I didn__ think that was true but I wanted to make him comfortable so we agreed to never bring him up again. Unfortunately that didn__ happen. Routinely my boyfriend would accuse me of being in love with him or just ask if I had talked to (let__ call him Jake) recently. He became obsessive and aggressive with it. During this time my boyfriend also started getting mad at me if I would ever say no to sex. He would scream at me, accuse me of having other sexual interests, and essentially give me 2 options: I get screamed at for not wanting to have sex, or I have unwanted sex. He assaulted me continuously for the next 2 months.  Then came out 1 year anniversary. We had planned to just go out to dinner and hang around his place. I go over and he went through comments on my Instagram post and my friend had commented __oure hot_ this guy who was literally my MIDDLE SCHOOL boyfriend liked the comment. My boyfriend asked me about it and I was like __ol that__ manny he was my middle school boyfriend, he means no harm I just don__ give him attention_. Of course that set off my boyfriend and he accused me of having feelings for my middle school boyfriend and we spent our anniversary fighting. My boyfriend told me I needed to block Manny I said I wasn__ comfortable with him telling me who I can and cannot have on social media, I__ loyal and that__ what should matter. That didn__ stop the fighting but I need to fast forward.  The day before Easter we got in a fight about Manny because he had swiped up on a photo of me and said something vaguely like a compliment I can__ remember. I showed my boyfriend because he asked me to show him. I didn__ reply to manny__ text. This set my boyfriend off __hy don__ you just fucking block him?!?_ I replied __f I__ not replying I don__ need to block him, I__ faithful and loyal this doesn__ need to be a big deal_. It of course became a big deal. We fought about it all day. He asked if he could still come to my families Easter dinner. I said explicitly __nly if you don__ fight with me_.  Easter. My boyfriend comes over and there is some tension between us from the previous day. He is acting a bit weird but things are okay. We are sitting in the living room with my entire family and I get a text from my partner ( even tho he is sitting right next to me) the text is a screenshot of Manny__ insteagram with a photo from 3 days ago (that means 2 day__ before manny complimented my ohoto) and my boyfriend circled my name in the __eople who liked this post_. He sent that and a text that said __ou just can__ help yourself, you__ be happier with him:)_. I was like __tf that photo is from 3 days ago which means I liked it before yesterday__ fight_. He was accusing me of cheating yet again. I asked him to leave my family was uncomfortable, he refused to leave. I left the living room and went to my own room. He continued to text me and I continued to ask him to leave. I told him explicitly __nly come if you won__ fight with me_ and he was there fighting with me. I reminded him of that and he told me __y behavior warranted his aggression_. He came into my room and told me if I couldn__ act normal and go back into the living room he would break up with me. I wish I ended things there.  My graduation.  My family has a hard time getting along. Divorced parents kids feeling like they have to pick a side type relationship. My graduation was cancelled due to covid and I was obviously upset about that. My school had a drive in graduation. My sister refused to come because she was mad i got a graduation gift from out grandmother (who gave her a graduation gift but did it in person, I got mine in the mail). My brother refused to come because he was mad  at my mother (not too sure what that story is) and my dad didn__ come because him and my mother cannot stand eachother enough to be in the same car. My boyfriend overslept my drive through graduation. So just my mom came. I balled my eyes out so hard, I just wanted to be supported by my family. I had thrown my siblings cute quarantine birthday parties (baked cakes got takeout for the family) and they couldn__ come to my fucking graduation. I was heart broken. When my boyfriend finally woke up I told him how hurt I was. He came over and spent the day with me. I was just so down and sad. He asked me to spend the night and I was hesitant because I just wanted the day to be over. He said he would be kind and cheer me up. So I went over. We stayed up hanging out and at about 2 am I said I was going to go to bed. He then asked me if Jake had texted me about graduation. I said no and told him I haven__ talked to Jake in over a year. He accused me of lying. I told him I was already so hurt eith today and told him I couldn__ take this and to please stop. He then told me he __new I was going to cheat on him bevause the apartment I was moving into was closer to Jake__ house than it is to his_ I literally begged him to stop. He wouldn__ he screamed at me until 4 AM. I didn__ take my car to his house because he wanted to drive me. I begged him to take me home. He wouldn__. He told me if I went home we are over. I told him to take me home. The next day I got out of bed at 1 pm, I was supposed to see my dad, my boyfriend called me threatening suicide. I spent the day watching him instead.   Fast forward to now and this last month.  My boyfriend said he wanted to fix this. I voiced that he is abusive and named the things he did to hurt me. He said he would fix his mistakes. Except this month every time I try to bring up something he has done to me he threatens suicide and I have to stay up till 4/5 am watching him. Genuinely this man is crazy, I__ scared the next stage of abuse will be physical. I__ trying to leave, but I still love him, and I know he__ been awful but I can__ help but remember the good times.   Thank you for reading my questions are. How to I bring myself to follow through with leaving (not come back, not be manipulated)?  How can I heal?  How do I not go back?  How do I end this as cleanly as possible?  Any input is greatly welcomed even if it doesn__ pertain to the questions.    TL;DR  My boyfriend is abusive, I need to leave but I still love him. He is threatening suicide. Need support and advice on how to leave."
emotional,I__ struggling,"Recently ended a relationship, 6 years long. I found messages that had flirting and he would tell me I__ crazy,  yell, scream, call me insecure. Now that I look back maybe they could__e been innocent? I just don__ know what to believe. But he__ throw things when angry or stressed at work. He took a lot of it out on myself even though it wasn__ directed at me. I tried ending it and he screamed, started throwing my stuff everywhere in rage. It freaked me out... left the next day without saying a word. It__ been almost 2 weeks no contact and I thought it would be so much easier than how I__ still feeling. No closure, no sex, constantly wondering if I__ a narcissist for how I ended the relationship, my head is so overwhelmed with thoughts and I can__ help but think maybe i was the toxic one all along. I can__ wrap my head around anything and I feel like he__ unfazed and probably doing better than I am. Part of me wishes he__ text me. I don__ have much support or anyone to talk to, so this was my last resort.  #struggling"

But what if I *am* being a dramatic teen?  * Is it dramatic if I say that I feel as though I have no control over my body? * Is it dramatic if I say that I feel as though she owns me?  Is it *normal* to feel as though you are a doll? A pet?  I do not doubt that she loves me, but_  _does she love me as a daughter?   Or does she love me as a favorite toy?  *Am I even human?*  I apologize if this is dramatic. It was originally supposed to be a genuine question__nd it still is__ut it appears as though I have released most of my pent-up feelings as I went. I'm sorry for being dramatic. Just__ don't think I can take much more. I'm scared. I feel like she owns every cell in my body. I feel like I have no control. Like I have no identity outside of ""daughter."" I'm sorry."
emotional,Abusive stbxh saves me from my MORE abusive dad. I feel stuck.,Shit went down. He had been emotionally abusive for the three year relationship and I finally stood up. I (25f) left him (25m) for like three months and I didn't plan on getting back with him. I stood my ground super well. He was staying with my parents in their basement bc he had nowhere else to go as things weren't final yet and I stayed in our apartment because I needed a break from everyone. Things were fine for a while and I felt healing occurring within me. Then my dad goes apeshit bordering on psychosis as this happens when he experiences panic attacks. He said a bunch of crazy shit and got violent one day when I went to pick up my daughter so my ex basically rescued me and we left and he said we are moving and just like that he picked up and moved with me into the city away from my parents. He saved me but now I don't know how to feel. He has made some major changes from his emotionally abusive past but I can't get that spark back. And when we were together I NEVER used to do this but now I find myself attracted to men I meet and see in public. What does this mean????  I hate the way I feel.
emotional,Now my mom is being abusive.,"Since my last post, a lot of things have happened, I had a discussion with my mom over my dad's abusive behavior, and essentially told her I hated him.  (If you didn't see my last post a month ago basically what happened is I asked if my stepdad was abusive, listed off things that qualified as emotional abuse and people of the subreddit let me know and gave me amazing advice also at the time of that post my mom wasn't being abusive)   I don't know if she told him, and I feel I told her out of pressure and just being emotionally fed up with it all.   After that, my stepdad started to act a bit better, so I'm guessing she told him how I felt about him. We've actually started to rebuild part of the relationship he destroyed for over 6 years, but it's still not fully healed at all, and I don't think it ever will.    But here's where I get to probably the worst part of this post, my mom has started to pick up the same behavior my stepdad did, and now, it's mainly just her yelling at me, and everytime she will make a mistake, she will somehow pin the blame on me. I was taking her trash out and it was difficult due to her pushing the bag down and I told her and the response I got was:  You deserve the difficulty for what you do to me!   Really?   I do alot around our house and when I go to sit down she's like: You haven't barely done anything today!  It's so.. frustrating.. and gives me alot of emotions.   I'm legitimately starting to feel scared around her the same way I still kinda am around my stepdad, I officially can't trust anyone within my family except my grandmother and cousin, my cousin being the only person I've told about my dad's behavior.   I have a sister, she's 7, and she seems to be picking up the same behavior from my dad but even worse.   I get called names, hit, told I'm the worst brother, etc. (I haven't come out as lgbtq to my parents as they're religious and homophobic so I'm sadly still being called my assigned gender_¤¦___ï¸)   I try telling my mom, but it isn't any use because she doesn't do anything about it, she essentially let's her get away with it.  I guess my emotions have really gone downhill within my last post too, I honestly think I have anxiety and depression from all of it, I can't say for sure but I'm 99% sure that's what I'm going through because of my parents.   Thanks for reading."
emotional,A mother who is only there when she likes the situation..,"Since she doesn__ believe there is such thing as depression I__ only sad because I__ far from god and I should stop complaining.   She would say no to everything every girl my age do because it hurts her ego that people around us might say bad stuff about us.   And when I had a serious self esteem issues and suicidal thoughts she laughed at me.   And she always repeat that I__ someone who is quite and wont complain even when I__ sick but when I do complain she think I just wants attentions and GOD forbids she give mes some.   My therapist was confused I got severe Pstd just from emotional abuse. I cant stay close to my mother or hear her eat it makes me want to just pull me hair.   I really wanna be a good daughter and work things with my mother because I believe she is trying her best to be who she is, We have 40 years age gap I always think that might contribute to these issues.   I just wanted to get that out of chest!"
emotional,Happy Anndivorsary to me!,"Six years ago today I divorced my physically and mentally abusive ex-husband. I know I wouldn't be alive if I was still with him. Since then, I've never been happier. I still suffer from major PTSD, depression, and anxiety, but at least I'm still alive. I have my hubby to thank for that.   If I could tell everyone who is in an abusive relationship one thing, it would be: ""It's never too late to get out of that situation. Seek help. You ARE worth more."""
physical,*venting* my eventful past month !!TW r*pe/ s3xu4l a55ault/ su1c1d3/d3ath/abu5e!!,"So a month ago i was raped, a week later i found out my friend was suicidal, my heart rat died, found out my dad planned to commit suicide, i started self-harming again, haven__ seen my younger siblings in close to a year purely because of their asshole mother, left my other younger sister to live with my alcoholic abusive mother(no way i could of taken her to live with my dad bc of her dad), had my friend walk in on her brother hanging himself &amp; had to comfort her &amp; lastly had my other friend that used to sexually harass me come forward about being molested. Honestly do not know how i haven__ necked myself yet, i started therapy again today though and im on meds for anxiety/depression, hoping i can heal from all this asap. im in year 11 and im pretty much failing already. Thanks 4 reading !"
physical,After math,"So basically I__ an 18 year old female and my ex boyfriend (the abused) is 17. the run down of the situation is that I dated a narcissistic drug dealer for a year. He did not start being violent until months down the line. He choked me when he was mad out me in headlocks until my vision blurred and I woke up screaming and he dropped me. Most recently he actually started slapping my back super hard and punching me very hard. I__ no small female I__ about 5_7 but he__ 6_1 and much bigger than me still. He left a giant bruise on my arm that I__ going to post here for reference.          I thought he loved me and I find it so hard to continue on without the person who once held me and kissed me forehead that beat me. He keeps calling me from fake numbers verbally harassing me, as if he hadn__ done enough to me. I__ jot sure why he hates me so much and it makes me very suicidal. I__e finally walked away and am going no contact forever. I feel like I failed myself, I lost all my friends because of him, and my self worth. Honestly the beatings would hurt so bad sometimes I couldn__ cry I would just sit there and wince and crawl out of my own skin. Does this get any better and please can someone tell me when will my self worth return.          He won__ stop harassing me and my friends calling us whores, etc, me worthless garbage, saying I was never anything to Him and he used me. I just want this all to erase and I never want to go through that again. I feel like all those things he said to me, though my sister says he__ just bullshitting because he wants attention. Can anyone please help me, I can__ afford a therapist? I would just like to know about how long this pain will last."
emotional,Should I tell my relatives about it?,"So here__ the situation: My parents want a closer relationship with me, but I (36M) have never wanted much to do with them, because I feel traumatised by my childhood. I__e always seen it as my cross to bear and have never talked about it to anyone. But now my parents are getting older and having health problems, but I__ not there for them.  My extended family think I__ a bad person for doing this, but they have no idea of what happened.  My younger brother only knows a fraction of what happened, which is limited to what he witnessed and went through himself. Most of this was the relatively milder stuff, however he__ much less critical of me.  Also, my younger brother attempted suicide about a year after I left home. At that time he was still living with our parents as he was still underage. He never wanted to talk to me about what motivated him to try and end his life, and I__e never forced the issue, nor have I told him about the serious emotional abuse that I experienced.  I__ wondering whether I should talk about it, or whether I__l regret letting that genie out of the bottle."
physical,My ex-wife abused me,"So I dont tell this story lightly. Before I begin I would like to say that there may be some trigger warning stuff in here so if your sensitive to that just dont read it. Also I say when I was a man which im a trans woman so that means when I identified as a man.   It all began in law school. I had been there attending when I thought I fell in love with my ex-wife. She was smart, brilliant etc. We married in 2000 and had 2 kids together. However she began being angry and abusing me physically and emotionally. She would yell and scream at me when I did something she didn't like. She would dig her sharp fingernails into my skin. She would slap me. She would force me to have sex with her even if I didn't feel like it. I put up with it for our kids who were young and needed 2 parent support. What she did constitutes as physical and emotional abuse. I had an affair with a male co-worker of mine which pissed her off immensely when she found out in 2006. She yelled, she screamed, she threw things at me. Put her hand around my throat. By the way I wasn't fighting her back because I knew how domestic violence cases against men were ignored and even laughed at by police. And I was not much taller than her at 5'5 myself and her just I would say half an inch shorter. I made a run for it. I wasn't going to be killed. I got her hand off my throat. She got a heel and stabbed me though I didn't feel it. I ran towards the stairs. And she pushed me I know she did. I went falling down the stairs. I suffered a concussion, lacerations on my face and body some of which needed stitches, a broken arm and a sprained foot. I lied and said I fell down the stairs. I didn't want to be humiliated by the police nor did I want to take my kids mother away. In a way I still had loved her. It would result in a 3 year legal battle which she stubbornly wanted as much as she could take. The kids, the house every single thing. I had to fight and fight to even get visitation rights. She threatened me with texts, bombarded my house phone so much I had to move far away from her. I filed for a restraining order which I did receive. Eventually we divorced in 2009 and me traumatized. I couldn't talk about it cause at the time I identified as a man. Its dragged on me for over a decade. Though moving out West. Though another marriage to a man. Though visits with the kids. Though moving back east and starting my gender transition. Its left me numb. I have never come back from this and probably never will. I was abused and people mock it. I just hope this community can bring me shelter."
emotional,How to NOT allow an established behavior pattern to start a flight.,"So I got up early (BY MY STANDARD) to go out with my mother. I've been having a lot of issues with her lately and finally decided the best defence was to simply NOT be there whenever possible.  So I get into the car and we Are not even two blocks away from the house when my mom starts: "" You know you've got all this time on your hands and your just wasting it"" (this was true to be honest, if you ignore the time I've spent hiding from her). If that was all she said I would have simply AGREED. But nope.   ""I lost a pair of good gloves! I can't find them, they just vanished etc....""  Some context: My mother is INCAPABLE of keeping gloves for some reason. She's always losing them, along with her phone and her purse. AND BY LOSING I mean she has a 5 second span of time in which she assumes it's missing because she can't instantly find the thing __. And this has been going on for YEARS.  Needless to say when your stuck in a car with her this gets REALLY IRRITATING __. SO in my infinite wisdom I responded "" MOM your always losing gloves"" AND THEN WE WERE OFF TO THE RACES!  An argument almost immediately started and we were only a block from the __...   Both me and my mom.are experts at not giving an inch of ground.  So deciding I wasn't willing to be stuck in an argument even if it was partly my fault for the next hour, I just opened the door while we waited at a red light and my mom wound herself up. I got out a d walked back home.  THAT'S how I've decided to deal with THESE constant Stupid petty fights over nothing. Whenever possible I will walk out and I don't care who started it, wait for the situation to cool down and hopefully nobody is holding a grudge.  If they are well it won't be me by that point.  ANYWAY how have you dealt with similarly stubborn people in your life?"
physical,Update: I'm (27F) still scared to leave husband (28M) but I will.,"So I made this post 9 days ago.  https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/pi0lwy/im_27f_scared_to_divorce_husband_28m_but_i_know_i/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share  And things of course didn't get better but nothing horrible has happened since. The place he poked me had been very sore, Google says the rib was bruised. Deep breaths hurt. Pushing with my right arm hurt. Raising my arm hurt. I was woken up out of my sleep when the cat he doesn't hate stepped on the poked spot. But there never was a bruise. It's feeling better now. We were/are in the love cycle again. But I can see it fading again. This morning I saw the cat he hurts has signs of an ear infection. I wanted to call the vet. ""No, not until it gets worse. We've spent more money on bills than this cat is worth. I hope it ruins his brain and he can't jump. I don't care about him. I hope this is it"" followed by ""don't ruin my mornings, do you want to make me late for work, I already told you to stay out of my way in the morning"".  And since this post I told my Dad, not every detail, but he knows now. The plan had been I leave with them when they went to drop me off but I chickened out. But after my husband left for work this morning, I put my important docs in a to go bag. Social security card, birth certificate, old immunization record, 2 copies of our marriage paper and he can have the one. I think that's all. Tomorrow I hope to put one together for the cats and grab some clothes for myself. I believe the hurt cat should be able to hold out until Thursday, when I plan to go to my parents and then I either not go to work or Indo for some normalcy. Idk yet but I need to inform my boss that Thursday I need to come in late or not at all.  I still don't feel ready to leave. Idk what I'm waiting for. But the cat is ready, he's been ready. I have to protect him. I know my husband will say I left him for cats, threw away 10 years for a cat. But I did read some of Why Does He Do That and I realized I was wrong about the abuse. I thought it started in 2018, after we got our own place. But it started earlier, maybe even back when we were in high school. When he first told me that I ""ruin everything, what's wrong with me"". I remember now sitting on the bus, upset and pleading as he was silent towards me because I made plans with friends when he had been planning on making plans with me. I cancelled those plans to prove I loved him. I was 17. So was he. It's still hard for me to call him and abuser, I know I've been abused and the abuse doesn't just materialize, but it's hard to look at him even when I get pissed and say he's abusive. He's abusing me yes, but he's abusive, no.  I'm going to text my Dad now, ask if he can change the locks because idk where my husband put their key or if he gave it back. But Thursday I'm moving back in. I'm done."
physical,I'm unsure of what I should do,"So I never properly knew my aunt, my mother didn't like to visit her often, but she's been coming over to our house a few times recently. She refuses to eat a lot of food, saying she's not hungry, and she looks a lot thinner than I remember from when I used to see her as a child. She speaks quietly with her head bowed and the past two times she's had sunglasses on at all times, even though it was cloudy and we were inside. She's also said a few times that me and my sisters should visit, but I haven't.   Today my grandad came over to our house to give my mum some plants and I overheard him and my mum speaking. I don't fully understand the language he speaks but I heard my aunt's name in the conversation. I think he said that she'd said that she had been hit multiple times (again I couldn't understand the language properly so there is a chance that I misunderstood) and she also didn't want my grandad to sit next to her. I'm assuming the part about her being hit because I only heard her name and words for being hit in the sentence. From my grandad's tone he had seemed incredulous, like my aunt was lying (she's married to his son).  And I'm unsure what to do because a part of me doesn't want to believe that my uncle would ever do something like this (from what I remember he was always really nice to us, but I know that's not a good enough reason).  And I'm unsure of what to do because I'm afraid of being wrong and my parents dismissing my worries because I'm only fifteen. But I also know that this isn't something I should push aside if it is ab*se. A part of me doesn't believe that something like this would ever happen to someone in my family."

emotional,Is a secret relationship emotional abuse?,"So I recently got back in touch with a girl I went to high school with, who reminded me of a situation where she (autistic, unpopular, stereotyped as the 'weird girl') was in a secret relationship with a popular jock guy. She lost her virginity to him, and they were 'together' for over a year, but he wouldn't even acknowledge her in the halls, speak to her in public, be seen with her etc etc. He is now married with a family, and lives a seemingly normal life. She has also been able to move on, but it left her with a lot of trauma for many years.  I'm inclined to think of this as emotional abuse. I'm not trying to tell her how to define it or anything like that - i'm just wondering when i search on abuse websites they seem to define emotional abuse as more like - controlling behaviours, rather than neglectful or dismissive behaviours.   (anyone read 'Normal People'? - not unlike that, except they don't then get over it and fall in love or whatever)."
emotional,I__ trying to make sense of how I am as a person &amp; why I pick bad life partners,"So I was abused as a child both by my mum &amp; my dad emotionally &amp; physically. Nothing I ever did was good enough for them at any age. I couldn__ wait to escape the family home &amp; go to university as it was away from them. It probably explains a lot. I__e been married 4 times &amp; engaged 7 times - ouch that sounds a lot. I__ well aware that I am probably looking for someone that probably doesn__ exist but the life partners I do find are lacking &amp; tend to be emotionally abusive to me. Not all of them.  I left my first husband because I don__ think I knew how to handle him as he wasn__ abusive. Therefore I probably didn__ find him as exciting. Maybe I crave a bit of drama but of course when you get older then you seek stability &amp; security.  I__ currently in a very much Jekyll &amp; Hyde relationship where my bf can be a nice person if he wants to be but he can also be the worse life partner you can imagine. I have left him 3 times. I__e never been that way before. We were living together but I have gone back to my house in a different city away from him at the moment as we clearly need space &amp; I am getting therapy as soon as I next get paid. He has been abusing me since I moved in with him in mid April &amp; by the start of July, I left him. He chased after me with lots of pitiful emails with lots of promises of changed behaviour. I went back to him&amp; within weeks, we were back to how we were.   He is an extremely belligerent person who always has to be right. It has to be his way, no point in wasting your energy arguing with him. Half of me loves him but the other half hates him &amp; I just don__ even understand myself."
physical,Turned on by another victim,"So I was subjected to extensive abuse,  repeated rapes and violent assault by my ex-boyfriend and one occasion his friend. I called the police, pressed charges, police let them go. Him and his friends harassed and terrorised me for years until I eventually had to leave my home town.   Last year I got in touch with another woman he raped. I knew because he__ told me about her. I knew he broke his ex-girlfriends ribs, I don__ know her, I don__ know her surname and I can__ find her. I suspect there__ many more but after becoming socially isolated I can__ get anyone to tell me where she is.   A few months ago yet another woman contacted me saying he__ assaulted her a year ago. I encouraged her to go to the police but didn__ force the issue as I knew from experience how traumatising it is. I also felt responsible for it happening to her too because maybe if I could of handled things better he would__e gone to jail but I know logically without any of the witnesses (his friends) willing to co-operate with police they won__ do anything.  I don__ blame the other women for not going to the police at all, it does however make me feel very isolated. Lockdown is just ending in my country and I was not only upset to know he__ gotten away with it again, our __riends_ witnessed him assaulting another woman and bullied her into keeping quiet. I__ already told everyone we know about what they did me, I__ posted about it on Facebook, I__ tried to find the other victims. It__ not a secret what happened but I__e been so slandered and smeared no one seems to believe me.  So I thought the best way to try and warn people about what was happening was to send an anonymous message. Purely stating the facts without emotion, this man has assaulted numerous women, it__ still happening and his friends are bullying victims. I said if there__ anyone else this has happened to please contact us, I left links to local rape crisis support if they didn__ want to talk to me. I did not mention the names of anyone specifically, the whole point was that the message was anonymous so they couldn__ single any one person to attack. I thought well I__ the only person who ever talks about it publicly so if they__e going to single someone out it will obviously be me right?   Wrong. They went after the woman who most recently was attacked, their friends started calling her up calling her a liar even though she has never accused anyone directly and only a few close friends know what happened to her. They also started harassing a woman who__ setting up a charity to support victims of rape and assault in our city. I honestly didn__ expect that to happen, maybe I should__e done. Really it kinda proves my point - they do this then get their friends to harass and intimidate us. I just want it to stop, I want to keep other women safe, I wanted to find the other victims and tell them they__e not alone.  Now these two women are really mad at me for doing this. They__e saying I betrayed her trust but I didn__ think just saying __t__ happened to someone else recently_ would be putting such a target on her back. No names were mentioned except our abusers, I made no allusions to anyone__ identity at all but they__e saying I mentioned her by name which I did not. I__e apologised profusely but at the same time I don__ really know what else I could__e done. It__ hard for me to stay silent, I can__ pretend I don__ know this is still going on. I feel like if I sit back and do nothing it__ my fault when he destroys the next girls life and the next and the next. I don__ expect the other women to feel the same as me, I understand they just want to keep quiet about it and try to move on but I can__. Every time I see me or another victim being slandered and harassed it brings it all back. I understand there__ no hope of justice, I just wanted people to know this was going on in the hope it might keep someone else safe. I just can__ sit back and do nothing but now I feel responsible that now these women are being harassed because of what I did."
physical,Please help . Thanks,"So I__ a 28-year-old male my fianc_© and mother of my children is a 30-year-old female. My home is in California I own a small construction company and I work very hard, we__e hit each other before she__ probably hit me 1000 times more but that__ neither here nor there, every time I__e ever put my hands on her I go to jail, spend about $2000 cash to bail out and the charges get dropped, I__e learned my lesson shes told me not to hit her I stopped . Now here__ where my question comes in, she continues to hit scratch pull punch throw you name it! What I tend to do is I just will stop talking And just focus on one of my kids Which makes me even more angry and she will throw them computers punch holes in the walls until she gets my attention so I just called 911 because she threw my computer and it hit my kid and I told them that we were arguing so they can and restrained me and talk to her and made sure I didn__ hit her when I found out I did not they left didn__ even ask me anything About how I was or what__ going on....  so lesson learned I__l never call the police again_ Am I the only one that thinks especially California that we were focused on the wrong thing that__ so many cases like this go unnoticed well we constantly focus on the woman or a black person etc. Is this just the way it is? To be honest my plan is to pack up and move to a different state anyways I guess I just wanted to let y__ll know that there__ 2 sides to every mirror.. the one you see and the one you don__."
physical,Helping a neighbor,"So I__ in need of some guidance. My wife and I just moved into a new condo, a four unit building. We met all the neighbors as we were getting the place ready to move in and at first glance everyone seemed pretty kind and welcoming and they appeared to have an already established community that we looked forward to becoming apart of. However, the first night we realized that the one couple living below us was clearly exercising a lot of toxic behavior. The boyfriend, who I believe to be a non-permanent resident, is always drunk and angry. It__ almost a nightly routine for him to be slamming doors, yelling and cussing through their unit and spilling outside of the condo and into the yard and street. One night I got home late and they were getting home, clearly heavily intoxicated, and he was being extremely verbally abusive. My wife over heard him saying he would get a gun and shoot them both. From talking to the other neighbors, this has been a regular occurrence since they moved in as well. Reports have been filed to the landlord and authorities and nothing seems to change. I__ the only other adult male in the building and I feel a strong urgency to intervene in the situation that I witness physical abuse, but I know the verbal and emotional abuse can be just as harmful. I would love some direction from people who have experienced this sort of abuse and wish they could have informed their own neighbors how to be most helpful."
physical,Forgotten everything,"So I__ in the process of reporting a sexual assault to my college, and over the past month or so I__e been working with a counselor there to write up a report and to prepare to submit it. However, my idea of what happened had been changing over time _ at first I remembered that he (my ex) had pretty blatantly ignored that I had said no and kept going, then I thought that I had said yes because I was afraid he__ hurt himself if I said no, and then I thought that maybe I had said yes after I had said no because he had made me physically __xcited_ and then I thought I must have wanted it. But today I decided to look back through our text messages to see if I could find one that I was missing (for the report), and I came across a lot of my texts from either the nights of or the mornings after I apparently thought he had assaulted me (of course I didn__ think that back then though) _ in those texts I seemed so okay with what had gone on, would text __oodnight!_ or __ood morning!_ with smiley faces or heart emojis and I guess that threw me off because of the things that I thought happened really did happen, I can__ imagine I__ still be acting like that. Also, in his texts he was always checking in to see if I was okay or apologizing for maybe being inappropriate or being too much, and that doesn__ fit with him doing the things that I had thought he did.   Then, this afternoon/evening, I suddenly realized I couldn__ remember any of it at all. When I try to think back to anything that happened in our relationship, it__ all foggy, or I feel like I hit a wall where my brain won__ let me go any further and just blanks out.   My counselor just got back to me tonight saying that she got in contact with the school__ investigators. The next step in the process is to submit the report and then do the interview. I__ really scared that I either won__ remember enough or that I somehow made all of this up in my head and now will get him in trouble for something he didn__ even do.   Anyone have any experience with forgetting things like this? Did I just make all of this up in my head and now I__ remembering what really happened? Or is this more of the self-blame sort of thing that everyone seems to be talking about, because if I__ wrong and I did make it all up somehow and believe it was real, he could be put on probation or expelled for no reason, and I can__ stop worrying about it"
emotional,Silent treatment because I didn't get ice cream,"So I'll keep this short... Yesterday I took my teenage sister to get ice cream (wasn't planning on getting any myself I was literally just taking her because she wanted some). When we got home my dad didn't care but my mom became extremely petty, she made a group chat with my sister and I in it and berated us for not thinking of anyone but ourselves and how it would have been nice if we got some for everyone else or asked. We didn't respond because what would we even say... Well today we decided to stop at the ice cream shop again since we were out running errands. We called our mom and asked if she wanted anything but was again petty and said no she wanted ice cream *YESTERDAY* not today. When we got home she refused to talk to us and gave us both the silent treatment... Keep in mind I am an adult and only temporarily staying with them. I asked her nicely why she didn't want any ice cream today since she wasn't happy we didn't ask yesterday.... Big mistake. She got angry that we only think about ourselves and how she would have liked ice cream YESTERDAY, she didn't want it today and it was too late now. Later on I heard her on the phone with someone, she blew the entire story out of proportion making us sound like we are the devil's children. I don't understand why she couldn't have communicated better with us, I get we could have asked but we didn't think of it at the time and tried to make up for it the next day. Also I feel guilty ranting about this because it's not as bad as she usually acts but this came out of nowhere and I haven't lived at home in a while."
physical,My story and a plea for advice,"So I'm new here and need to get this story out so here goes.  For reference X = my ex boyfriend M = oldest son  I met X when I was 16. We met on a chat room and looking back I think I fell more in love with the idea of him than anything else. We talked as friends for about four months before he decided it was time to take it to the next level. I was so flattered. At the time I hated everything my parents stood for and he was basically the opposite. I can see how he was grooming me even then, especially after we started video chatting.  When I turned 17 he asked me to marry him (never did happen for which I am so glad of) and I ended up running away. Biggest mistake of my life and one I think I will regret always.   He paid for me to come to the state he lives in. When I got here he well he was nothing like what he had shown himself to be. I was not allowed out of the house the first five months and was expected to keep up with housework, prepping meals, and pleasing him. If I didnt do any of these satisfactorially I got punished. I don't remember if it was because I got pregnant or I stopped trying to escape but after five months he started letting me go shopping and I could go to the doctor only if he was there. He was so good at playing the devoted father.   Our oldest son was born January 2018 and less than a week after a birth with tearing involved I was expected to please him. I got pregnant again and gave birth in October 2018. Our youngest was born February 2020. All boys.   I lost track of the ER visits I had to make or how many times I had to tell the boys to be quiet when daddy was home because he wants to watch some stupid show. Or how many times our oldest would cry because I got punished. There was no way for me to get out. If I was allowed out it was on a strict time schedule and he had a track on my phone the entire time. He even used to show off and announce to me where I had been.   Then he got into a car accident in June 2019 and long story short couldnt work or so he said (I think he could have but so glad he chose not to). I hated leaving the boys with him but had no other choice when he told me to get to work. I started work as a maid and my trainer (turned best friend) noticed what was wrong. She never pushed me to leave until I broke down and just spilled the entire story. She helped me save the money needed. When the pandemic hit she made sure I was able to come back to work when the place reopened or at least helped to.   When I was able to get back to work we made an exit plan so I could leave with my boys. The hardest part I could see at this time was that he had never abused the boys physically. He also wasnt neglectful. They never had a diaper rash or went hungry but they were craving attention.   Durring all this I found out I was pregnant again. When the NIPT test results came in about a month ago and told us this coming baby is a girl he lost it. I have never seen him in such a rage and all the while claiming it wasnt his child because he only produced boys. He threw me up against a wall and had his hand around my throat when clear as a bell we hear my oldest saying our address into the phone. M has always been on the mature side especially for a two year old. He has his moments but is caring and considerate and has the vocabulary of a five year old.  I had taught him with my most recent pregnancy how to call 911 if something happened because a few times I'd had fainting spells and X wouldn't do a damn thing. X runs to him and ends up throwing M against the wall too enough to give him a concussion. Thankfully the 911 operator still had a unit come out and long long story short he got arrested.   I got an order of protection and custody as of right now. He got denied bail and waiting on court date right now. The last time I saw him he screamed that he would kill me and make our kids watch.   My friend helped me move out into a one bedroom apartment (rent here sucks majorly and its what I can afford.). Since the house isn't in my name at all cant stay there. She helped me get another job within the company she works for now and its at home so I dont have to worry about daycare but I am so lost right now.   Ive got a 2 year old, 1 year old, and 5 month old with another on the way. I feel like I just moved to another state because I don't even know this one. My friend says I should contact my parents but I just don't know. Its been about 3 years since I even spoke to them.   My main problem right now is that it just feels like I'm stuck in place. Or on a teeter totter.   On one hand I know I did the right thing and I know this is the right move. But part of me also wishes he were still in our lives the way he was. I knew what was expected of me then. I knew what to expect and what few decisions I did make were based off of that but now I don't know. I feel lost in my own life lost at sea especially and I'm trying to be everything for my kids but I cant. And I'm on here typing this because my youngest is sick and just wants mommy to hold him all the time. He finally fell asleep but I decided to join redit after my friend suggested it. As for my story its been swirling in my head so damn much and I'm hoping for well I dont know right now.    Am I feeling normal? Do you have any advice at all?   I hope its ok I posted here."

emotional,I don__ even know.,"So in case you haven__ seen me before: Both of my parents have neglected me all my life but my mom is the main perpetrator.  Anyway.  After dropping my little sister off at school today, my mom informed me she works be giving her the silent treatment and taking away her phone and laptop because she__ __eing unruly_.  I.  Feel sick.  I can__ think. I wanna cry. *I can__ think.* I__e been in severe emotional distress for a little over 30 minutes now and it__ *killing me.*  I wish I was able to speak up and at least tell her that basically ignoring her can only do bad things. We__e both used to the threat of stuff being taken away.  If anything. Why did she have to tell me?  I don__ know. I just. Feel sick."
emotional,I have to have 2 of my wisdom teeth removed tomorrow and I'm really nervous,So I've had this done before but the first time i was on local anesthetics and was aware and etc (not a good time) but this time I'm supposed to be approved for nitrous Oxide (laughing gas) and I'm really afraid that I'll say the wrong thing or out myself on something to my mother (who is my abuser) and I don't know what to do.  I'm so worried.
emotional,"update ig ? finding someone new , break ups and just being sad","So law school is weird but nice , I haven't heard from him since my last update and I'm going to make sure to keep it that way .  Buttttt I also met a guy , we're in the same class. He's super fun and super nice and can't lie I'm kinda thankful to him , because while I realised that I deserved better I didn't know what the bench mark was . And boy was it way more than I expected . I mean he treated me so good , and i don't even mean it in a romantic way , he's an amazing friend and he's really really amazing . like he's set the standard so damn hard , it kinda made me realise that i didn't have to put up with that . I deserved so much better   But unfortunately he's transferring to a better law school so , what can i say , I'm pretty upset about it , it's only been a few days . but oh well , it's probbaly for the best , i have a lot to unlearn from my previous relationship   but man this feels so good"
emotional,Back talk,"So my dad is an extremely controlling manipulator and has been for my whole life. If you so much as even slightly do something he doesn__ like or see as perfect he__l take it as a personal vendetta and gaslight you into thinking you__e a horrible person. I am now 18 and a lot of his old manipulation and abuse tactics don__ work on me anymore but he still needs to feel that total control over me and any situation he__ in. So when you disagree with him about anything he__l say things like __top back talking_ which basically means I__ always right you don__ even get to respond. Now if you do continue to respond even if it__ in the most respectful way possible he will begin to yell and gaslight me saying things like __ou__e always right_ even calling me a __ick_, __sshole_, a __rick_, often times much worse of course. But I think the worst of it all is that he doesn__ even try to hide it. Him and my mom are separated and I came to live with him for the summer thinking things might be different. But we got into an altercation today because I called him __an_ which he took as a sign of extreme disrespect he got very aggressive with me calling me names and saying he was going to send me home on the next flight tonight. He then came into my room a few minutes later telling me I was his __ubordinate_ and if I wanted to stay I have to obey him. Yeah... that__ how he values me. I am an inferior second class person that needs to obey him at all times, obviously I tried to respond to him but was met with immediate anger and told not to __ack talk_. All in all it really makes sense through the years of emotional abuse and manipulation that this has always been his mindset on his children. The issue here is that by even attempting to speak my mind to him would only make things 100x worse, he__ gaslight to the point where I__ legitimately cry. I just don__ know what to do here. As much as I shouldn__ submit to his manipulation and abuse I do think it would be smart to lay low for a while and not cause myself anymore stress or trouble. I think eventually I__ going to have to come up with some sort of excuse as to why I need to go home because I already see where this situation is headed."
emotional,Stonewalling abusive husband,"So my husband doesn__ touch me. We had sex maybe 4 or 5 times in 3 years. He doesn__ respect me, doesn__ provide, gives me the silent treatment all the time if he__ annoyed even the slightest.   What happens - if I stop caving in and don__ speak to him?   It__ been 2.5 months we live together and he is stonewalling me. What if I continue to stonewall back now - will he be the first to initiate divorce?   The more he ignores me the more resolute I become this time to keep ignoring him too."
emotional,Emotional coldness,"So my narc bf &amp; I are on the 4th round of trying again, I honestly thought we would be done after the last time we split &amp; we were living apart &amp; no contact. He still had some of my stuff so when I could contact him ( short story - he had me revenge arrested but charges were dropped &amp; no further action) I had to contact him which started us talking again.  And he said he wanted me back - we have seen each other twice seen them. He came to see me the next day as he was working away for a few hours &amp; then I went to see him at his place last Fri night &amp; stopped off &amp; went back late Sat night.  He is being emotionally cold &amp; playing the victim. Whereas he used to phone me whenever he could &amp; message now it feels distant &amp; he has made me feel like I can__ pick up the phone &amp; ring him just because as we used to.  Yes it is early days &amp; he is aware of how he is as he says he will warm up eventually but I cannot do emotional coldness like this &amp; yes I know he is a narcissistic &amp; what the hell do I expect? He is making plans with me to do stuff together but I need more emotional investment - in my view, we should be working towards living together again &amp; I also suggested couples therapy"

physical,I need a trauma therapist can someone help me,"So on February 28th my brother moved back in and dislocated my shoulder. The next day he beat me up again and destroyed my room. This continued until June, while I was and still am dealing with a serious injury. Broken ankle in 5 places in May, unrelated to the abuse.   I'm suffering from severe physical trauma and sexual harassment over the past 6 months. I can't stop re living these moments and am turning into the one who wants to cause a problem. I want revenge but I know its bad. I have nightmares about getting beaten up at 5 am out of no where so I'm constantly on guard now.   I need a therapist to help me cope with these thoughts of keeping myself from doing to him what he did to me, but worse. It's scary to think but what he's done to me makes me hate him so much I don't care what I do to him. I wouldn't follow through with any of this because I wouldn't want legal problems, but I seriously need someone to talk too"
physical,My moms boyfriend abuses me her and my brother,"So she's with him for like 4 years now and I have to live with her because Iv just turned 18 and I still have to go to school  my brother is like 24 and he has autism  so he really doesnt anything of what is going On. My mom keeps telling me and him that things like that are normal in every family but ive never seen any of my friends moms walking around with a black eye._¤ã_ _ So the guy im talking about is a obese alcoholic and a drug addict he constantly breaks something and everyday he hits my mom and screams at her he once attacked my brother (that guy is 6'3 and my bro is like 5""7) and he constantly keeps telling us how worthless we are and how our dad should die (my dad has cancer and that guy knows that this hurts us the most) and he is threating us that one day he is going to kill us.   My mom started to feed me with xanax and sleeping pills  so I can feel better about everything that is going On in that house (and its not working) ive had 2 suicide attempts and now I feel like im dying. My grandma wanted to help us but my mom told her that everything is fine and im just over reacting and sadly my grandma belived her. Now i feel like i have no choice but to kill myself or become homeless  Any advice appreciated"
emotional,Is this emotional abuse_ or am I overreacting?,"So to start off, I__e had a lot happen to me over the past year/years. Not going into much detail, I ended up leaving and living with my dad instead of my mom (I was going in between houses before)After living with my dad full time for about a year things started changing. Fights happen about every week or so which usually ends with me crying/hyperventilating and dissociating with everything around me.  I__e never been physically abused but I still am terrified of it potentially happening for some reason. He usually yells at me to shut my d*mn mouth and to stop b*tching and whining. He gets about and inch or two from my face or ear and screams at me to shut up and do what I__ told. If I cry I get told to shut my mouth and listen because I__ being dramatic and I__ being annoying.  I had a anxiety/panic attack at school in the car the other day and forgot to ask my school a question because I was trying to leave as fast as possible and not break down completely there. I was hyperventilating, crying, and was having trouble focusing in the car. I was yelled at that it was my fault I was having an attack and to shut up, listen, and breathe into my hands like it was a bag so I__ stop hyperventilating. (A traumatic event happened to me and doing that makes me shake and the anxiety/panic attack usually worsens being reminded of that time)   I tried to explain that I couldn__ do that and that I need it to be quiet so I can calm down and he screamed and yelled at me more and we drove away a little later (we had still been parked at the school) he blasted music said hurtful things and the attack didn__ stop until we arrived at a restaurant and he left the car.   This week we got into a fight and I was having another anxiety/panic attack. I was stuck on a math problem and when I figured it out I said that learning this was stupid as I wouldn__ need it for the career I was planning. He yelled again just like usual with the other times, but this time he forcefully shut my mouth closed. I was scared and my mouth was hurting. Things escalated_and I told him the reason I was crying was because of what he did. Convo became the topic of switching schools and He wouldn__ leave until I had talked about some sexual harassment I had experienced somewhat recently (which is why I had asked to transfer to a different school.)  More info: Prior fights lead to my phone being thrown across the room, other things thrown/breaking, cussing and told to go live with my mother (she is the reason for a lot of my trauma.) My dad said that he was surprised CPS hasn__ come again with me __verreacting/exaggerating_ things.  I__ just scared at what could happen in the future. My therapist knows that we fight but i never give details. CPS has been called for both of my parents multiple times but I never give info and act like everything is okay. My friends over the past year/couple years have told me this isnt normal for a family.   He gives me nice things and the next day it__ like nothing happened and he__ kind and happy again. Am I just overreacting?  Thanks for your time and replies, :)   TL;DR : Parent cusses and yells until I have an anxiety/panic attack, Blames me for my anxiety/panic attacks, throws my things across the room occasionally, forcefully shut my mouth which caused me to be scared/ in pain, I was forced to talk about my sexual harassment to explain why I wanted to switch schools, CPS has come in the past but I haven__ told them anything. Am I Overreacting? Is this normal? Should I tell my therapist?"
emotional,My mother still blames me for her emotionally abusing me because I didn__ heed to all of her commands.,"So well, my mother always yelled at me, insulted me, gaslighted me and all the other things. Resulted in self hatred , depression and now I__ just a useless slug. Anyways the story now is that I always try telling her why it__ not ok and how it affected me. I__e gotten as far as to her admitting not all was well when I was a child BUT that she wouldn__ have had to do it if I__ just listen to what she told me. I try telling her that kids are just wild but she doesn__ think so, it was just me. Apparently I did something wrong again today and she started telling me how I__ just never doing the things I should. And then she told me that when I was little she somehow thought I was deaf because I didn__ listen to her and she brought me to a doctor for a hearing test? Like haha wtf. It__ like my mother doesn__ even see other kids at their worst. Then she said that maybe again, my messed up youth was all my fault and that she had no choice but to do what she did. Her main reason is just cuz I was __lways so different_ and didn__ listen to her and did what I wanted. I just needed to get it off my chest because it__ been so bad again dealing with my parents."
physical,Advice: Moving back,"So when we broke up he went crazy and I left the place he lived, even though I went to school there, for my safety. He's in jail now in that same city and he can't afford to bail out. But this place is where the industry is for the career I want. So I got things in order to go back to go back to school in that same place and signed a lease for a year. But at the time I was thinking only about school and how I felt I needed to be there to do my career, I didn't even think about how moving back there might bring up old memories and I feel kind of stupid for signing the lease now. I know how to get out of the lease if I want to and I have a plan to get away from there if it really makes me feel bad when I go back but I also really want to go to school there. My school will only take a year and his charges carry a minimum of 10 months so I can leave right after but I just don't know how long they will keep him in jail for bc I'm not comfortable living there if he's out of jail because he has threatened me before. I don't know if I should just abandon school and stay away from that place and all the memories or go and leave if I don't like the feeling it gives me. I'm really unsure."
emotional,Is this abuse? Dad claims I'm a liar and can't be trusted after misunderstanding what he said.,"So, about two weeks back I (17F) had a bit of a problem with schoolwork and a misunderstanding between my teacher and I which made her send me to the principal. She said that she'd let me study for my tests first before having to go to him, so now two weeks later my dad (56M) and stepmother (57F) got an email from the principal about an official meeting.  Needless to say, my dad was angry I hadn't told him.   (There have been more than enough reasons to not tell him stuff from school as he has very extreme reactions to me doing bad in school, although I am getting good grades now. Classic strict / controlling parent.)  I explained that I had misunderstood what we had to give in as homework although I had finished it, I had misinterpreted the form in which to give it in and that caused the misunderstanding. Due to my teacher's time limits she couldn't do anything but send me to the principal to allow a re-do.   Now, our school is very strict on policy. I had a meeting with the principal yesterday to bring up my sides of the story and he told me that I was allowed to do a free re-do. Amazing! But, since I wasn't 18 yet he still had to plan an official meeting because of policy so we couldn't arrange a time for me to re-do the test yet. I had also had some problems with my school e-mail, and had messaged the ICT-Helpdesk at my school to help me out with the problems the same day. When I got home, my dad vaguely asked me if I'd sent ""the e-mail"" yet. Seemingly busy as he walked away before I could even answer, but I assumed he was talking about the ICT-Helpdesk e-mail.   He was not, I found out this morning. Now, some (opinionated) context. My dad tends to punish me by making me sit downstairs for a week or a few days because I'm upstairs a lot especially since I'm in my exam year and am busy with school and the time that I have left I try to spend playing games or coming downstairs every now and then for my parents' sake. The problem is, every time I bring up that I see being downstairs as a punishment my dad tells me that it's not and that it's always fun downstairs and never a punishment when he clearly uses it to punish me. I have two other siblings (19F and 21F) that don't get treated this way.   Anyhow, long story short, this morning the argument started when I told my stepmum again (I had told her and my dad about the conversation with the principal yesterday and that I still had to have an official meeting because of policy)  about what had happened and then my dad brought up that I said that I already re-did the test, which I didn't.   He asked me an extremely vague question to which he seemed to want an answer to fast so I responded with yes as I had already told him before that that I couldn't re-do my test yet. When I told him that I didn't say yes to that and misinterpreted the question because it was extremely vague he got extremely angry at me and called me a liar and that I couldn't be trusted and had betrayed him. He then continued to throw in a week of sitting downstairs, to which I broke down and started crying as I could not comprehend that he'd given me that punishment that fast without me being allowed to explain my side. When I tried explaining, he kept interrupting me and saying it didn't matter.  I'm currently in my room still shaking from what happened and so confused, but at the same time this is what happens most of the time. I'm almost turning 18 and I feel like nobody in this household ever listens to what I have to say and instead just throw punishments so extreme and unfair to me that it hurts me. This type of treatment from my dad and stepmum unfortunately isn't anything new, as I've experienced it since I was 14.  I just don't know what to do and I hope this subreddit can give me some advice or information as to what's really happening so I can talk to my psychologist about this, although I've already told all three of my psychologists about this and it doesn't really seem to change anything, so I'm at a loss, honestly. I'm not looking for a psychologist, just someone that can explain the reason behind this extreme instant punishment and these horrible claims from my father claiming I'm a liar. It has, throughout the years, caused a lot of self-doubt. Multiple times has he done this and multiple times has he also claimed that I didn't say what I said, twisting my words and making me doubt my own truth."
emotional,Is this abuse? Dad claims I'm a liar and can't be trusted after misunderstanding what he said.,"So, about two weeks back I (17F) had a bit of a problem with schoolwork and a misunderstanding between my teacher and I which made her send me to the principal. She said that she'd let me study for my tests first before having to go to him, so now two weeks later my dad (56M) and stepmother (57F) got an email from the principal about an official meeting.  Needless to say, my dad was angry I hadn't told him.   (There have been more than enough reasons to not tell him stuff from school as he has very extreme reactions to me doing bad in school, although I am getting good grades now. Classic strict / controlling parent.)  I explained that I had misunderstood what we had to give in as homework although I had finished it, I had misinterpreted the form in which to give it in and that caused the misunderstanding. Due to my teacher's time limits she couldn't do anything but send me to the principal to allow a re-do.   Now, our school is very strict on policy. I had a meeting with the principal yesterday to bring up my sides of the story and he told me that I was allowed to do a free re-do. Amazing! But, since I wasn't 18 yet he still had to plan an official meeting because of policy so we couldn't arrange a time for me to re-do the test yet. I had also had some problems with my school e-mail, and had messaged the ICT-Helpdesk at my school to help me out with the problems the same day. When I got home, my dad vaguely asked me if I'd sent ""the e-mail"" yet. Seemingly busy as he walked away before I could even answer, but I assumed he was talking about the ICT-Helpdesk e-mail.   He was not, I found out this morning. Now, some (opinionated) context. My dad tends to punish me by making me sit downstairs for a week or a few days because I'm upstairs a lot especially since I'm in my exam year and am busy with school and the time that I have left I try to spend playing games or coming downstairs every now and then for my parents' sake. The problem is, every time I bring up that I see being downstairs as a punishment my dad tells me that it's not and that it's always fun downstairs and never a punishment when he clearly uses it to punish me. I have two other siblings (19F and 21F) that don't get treated this way.   Anyhow, long story short, this morning the argument started when I told my stepmum again (I had told her and my dad about the conversation with the principal yesterday and that I still had to have an official meeting because of policy)  about what had happened and then my dad brought up that I said that I already re-did the test, which I didn't.   He asked me an extremely vague question to which he seemed to want an answer to fast so I responded with yes as I had already told him before that that I couldn't re-do my test yet. When I told him that I didn't say yes to that and misinterpreted the question because it was extremely vague he got extremely angry at me and called me a liar and that I couldn't be trusted and had betrayed him. He then continued to throw in a week of sitting downstairs, to which I broke down and started crying as I could not comprehend that he'd given me that punishment that fast without me being allowed to explain my side. When I tried explaining, he kept interrupting me and saying it didn't matter.  I'm currently in my room still shaking from what happened and so confused, but at the same time this is what happens most of the time. I'm almost turning 18 and I feel like nobody in this household ever listens to what I have to say and instead just throw punishments so extreme and unfair to me that it hurts me. This type of treatment from my dad and stepmum unfortunately isn't anything new, as I've experienced it since I was 14.  I just don't know what to do and I hope this subreddit can give me some advice or information as to what's really happening so I can talk to my psychologist about this, although I've already told all three of my psychologists about this and it doesn't really seem to change anything, so I'm at a loss, honestly.

emotional,Help? (A.K.A. Feeling stuck),"So, this is a rant, kinda;   With that being said, first and foremost, if it will affect you or if you__e not in a place where you need to take care of yourself first, it__ perfectly fine and please do so, there__ no shame in that.  No matter what, I want to express that I really thank you, whoever you are, to take time to read this to the end~!   I feel emotionally abused by my family, I do fear it__ just a perspective thing but I am aware that because I can understand why and where a person__ coming from, I tend to let most things slide.  I want to say that with confidence I know they (my parents) have good intentions, they are wonderful and good people, they just are horrible at accepting they are wrong in any way.  It could very well be because of traditional Asian culture, to accept feedback that screams anything but __ou__e great parents and are perfect_ from children is insulting to mostly all parents here.   My dad is a reasonable man, and he honest to god is sweet, but subconsciously his immediate reaction to someone voicing a different opinion than him is that they are wrong, basically; it__ hard for him to fully comprehend that people can have different opinions; if it__ from his colleagues he__l rant about them at home afterwards, if it__ from his kids he__l just __orrect_ them. I think it__ truly good to have strong independent views, but he often makes me feel wrong to have my own instead of simply disagreeing.   My parents are both passive-aggressive people, even if they disagree, it__ not really disagreeing. My brothers have learnt to not care, but I usually have to take the brunt of my parents out-lash of that. Now we__e all growing up, my brothers have started to see the problem with our parents (namely my mother), I have always seen the problem as well, but they lash out, and I don__ just because I can still understand where they__e coming from, but recently it__ been getting too much. And I just want to find a way to prevent myself from becoming numb (I already have bouts of..dark times?)   All in all, my dad just goes along with my mum, I don__ blame him, he used to voice his disagreements with my mum when she has hurt him verbally in the past but it always ends with she making him feel unreasonable, and not listening to his explanations, her actions contradicts her words. She does read self-help books, as too my dad, but her conclusion is mostly like __his really is an issue society today has, other people are always like this, this was a good surmise of that_ and any wrong pointed her way is disrespectful. It could be as simple as something she does regularly:  Her: __ow was the food?_  Kids: __ood!_ Her: __o fake..(just jokingantering)_ or __ust tell the truth!!! (Seriously mad)_ Kids: __t really is good!_ Or __aybe I just prefer less pepper but all in all it__ good, I just can__ take spice_ (true story) Her (out of the blue two days later while cooking): __ee see, if I put pepper later you'll say it__ not good_  That__ regarding the most simplest of things, I get maybe she__ insecure about it, but it__ same for many things, feedback, criticism etc. And I generally try to only give those when asked for it. It__ not too bad but it sometimes happens so much it really pains me, maybe it__ because I__ the child of high expectations and more maturity (or maybe not) only I seem to make an effort in trying to resolve conflict like this daily. My brothers just keep contradicting her and she takes it badly. They don__ necessarily say it with menace but she takes it as them having a problem, granted they could have worded it better. I can__ control what they say, but my parents (mainly my mum) usually starts turning and complains about them to me??? Mistakes and misunderstandings my younger brother cause are first blamed on me. I really understand that I can get better grades, or manage stuff better and hence they have higher expectations because of it, what I don't appreciate is them treating me differently.  Ex: my brother does something wrong gets laughed off, me doing something small wrong gets picked on.  I have direct contact with my younger brother__ teachers to help monitor his school work. My dad appreciates my help a lot but my mum tends to (and has frequently) lashed out and scolded me for his mistakes. I have tried voicing it but she then goes __h now I__ the bad guy_ (she says it frequently) and I know that__ likely gaslighting but I do know that she really does fear __eing the bad guy_; aren__ we all? I__ in no place (for reasons mentioned above) to tell her that to prevent being the bad guy takes effort and changes and action too. I keep trying to tell my parents many things to improve this family but honest to God it feels more like digging a hole for myself like a fool; there__ a point where you stop, I both fear and want to reach that point.   I actually appreciate my brothers being able to stand up for themselves (albeit not in the best way), but my older brother thinks himself as this wise exception, and does things with no regard to how it affects me and my younger brother basically can__ owe up to his actions, denies things and basically doesn__ feel guilt. I__e talked to them before but they frankly don__ really care. I__ very sure they love me, but I__ not sure if it__ that they need me more or love me more sometimes.  I have written a letter to acknowledge it, talked civilly to them before, cause even if I know it__ not a good idea, better try than not I guess. But my mum reacted to it the way she always does.   I__ a really family-oriented person, and truly I love them. I__ well-aware I could love someone but do it from a distance but trust me when I say that__ not gonna end really well either. And To be honest I want to keep having close relationships with them. To get a second-party to __reak the news_ would offend them and they__ scold me for __ver-sharing_ (prideful bunch). Distancing themselves from them is not quiet acceptable. Even if I were free to do so, I do still want to have close relations with them still, plus for reasons not disclosable I literally can__ leave them yet and is financially and legally dependent. I would like to get diagnosed and etc. cause I do feel empty sometimes (or frequently; it depends) but they don__ quite believe\ can accept their __olden child_ being less than perfect. Family Therapy is not an option to be honest, they act as different people in front of others so well I don__ think they realise. And it__ one of those things that they think they find acceptable but insulting when applied to themselves or children. Basically they wouldn__ not approve or just be harmfully passive aggressive in showing disagreement about it.  Any advice?  Truly, even if it__ just emotional support and just to read finish this whole long vomit of words__, I__ really grateful and Thank you for your time Stay safe__ Lots of love _¤ï_"
emotional,"I need help and guidance, I want to move out and be independent but, I don__ know how to.","Some background: my parents have always emotionally abused us. My mom is the main abuser and my father is an enabler.   I don__ know what set her off but, last night when I came home from work, she asked me if I found a car yet. I figured she was joking about the question so I said __o of course not_ in a sarcastic tone. She suddenly started calling my sister and I lazy.

Then, out of the blue, she told me __ell everyone else__ kids know what their doing, can do stuff on their own without their parents holding their hands, why can__ you?_  __ou never taught us how and we are not like the other parents kids_.  And in the most patronizing voice said __h I know you aren___.  My sister has been trying to move out with her boyfriend, to no surprise, my parents try to gaslight them into staying home.

emotional,Should I confront my friends that abandoned me or try to just forget about them,"Some time ago I have a falling out with a friend. He wanted to have a romantic relationship with me and was emotionally abusive. He destroyed my confidence and thought that because I didn__ stop him from crossing my boundaries that I had feelings too. I chose to run away from him by going out with a mutual friend. This friend was the exact opposite and builds me up and has taught me to set boundaries and that I don__ need to please everyone. We still together now and I__ happy with him. The hard part has been the other friends in the group. One has remained neutral. I am grateful to him. I never wanted anyone to choose sides and he treats me the same as before. The other two have completely abandoned me. One abandoned me as soon as she found out I was in a new relationship and I__e tried confronting her but she refuses to admit that she did anything different. She has ignored me and purposefully made plans without me. She says she needed to be there for the abusive friend (she didn__ know about the emotional abuse). The other abandoned me more recently. He heard the story from the other guy and immedietly cut off contract. At first I thought maybe he was depressed or something was wrong. I kept texting and inviting him to play cards but he ignored me. These two really hurt my feelings. I find that every time I__ alone with my thoughts i think about them. I__ sad, angry, and hateful. Ive let this drag out for a year figuring its to best move on but the thoughts wont stop. Should I confront them or keep pushing forward and try to forget them?"

emotional,Reactive abuse and reality.,"Something I struggle with is my partner calling me violent and abusive.  She__ even read the __hy does he do that_.   And tbh, I did react to her with things like physical constraint, pleading, begging her to tell me why she felt the need to ***torture me***.   My partner is undiagnosed but almost certainly has BPD. Two therapists have brought it up with her and she__ in deep denial.    This girl didn__ just emotionally abuse me. I literally wasn__ allowed to flush a toilet after 10pm. She crushed me. Everyone, my friends, her friends, family. We all saw it plain as day. She walked all over me and refused to validate how I felt when she was abusing me.   She put me through identical abuse she went through as a kid....   My codependent ass took this abuse indefinitely and I just let it build until I started to snap. I would yell and maybe once a month get baited into a fight where things would get physical...   Never any hitting, never raising a hand ever, but physical nonetheless....   My partner would try and use verbiage that implied I threatened her rather than reacted to months of torture and bait.   The same two therapists we__e had have called my abuse __eactive abuse_.    Reactive abuse isn__ an excuse for being abusive, it__ a descriptor....  My partner can__ handle this at all. She needs me to be the abuser. But I__ not the same abuser as she is. I__e stayed in therapy and addressed my actions endlessly now.  She still lives in denial after breaking up with me and doesn__ admit the horrors she put me through daily. The same horrors she experienced as a child."
physical,Progress after DV,"Sometimes I feel like I really haven't made much progress since I kicked my abusive ex boyfriend out over 9 months ago. Other people do say they see a positive change in me but I feel like I haven't really done enough.  The things I can think of that I have done is basically learning to live alone, go out on my own, do my shopping, pay my own rent and buy my own food. I also had to learn to basically protect myself, be assertive and keep safe without a guy's help which honestly is very difficult especially living in an unsafe area. However I still managed to.  I have also been in regular therapy for trauma for about 9 months. I have been studying which can be difficult. I also did my first work trial in years recently. My therapist has linked me up with other services, one of which will pay for a rental deposit for a new appartment for me to move into, as they want me to have a safe, fresh start.  I have also just recently been calling real estates/apartments to move into. This is the first time I've done this as usually my ex boyfriend would do all the speaking for me during our moves and in general. I called about 5 today despite being anxious and I think I did well. I also attempted driving a car for the first time recently and have paid for/been taking my written learners drivers test. I will just keep taking it until I pass. I have also been looking after my old cat very well and have been managing to get lifts if/when she's not well or needs check ups.  I didn't think I could manage that without the ex boyfriend either. I also have dated other guys since then an all though some were not good for me I still think I've grown and leant from those experiences. And I mean it was still nice to actually go out and eat nice food, go to nice places, etc as my ex boyfriend didn't work or take me anywhere. I hope that's actually progress."
physical,What can I do as a 17 year old?,"Sorry for the essay:  I__ 17 years old (male, turning 18 early feb), my parents are separated (have been since I was in primary school), and my mum__ new partner is abusing her.   He has a serious anger problem and drinking problem, his own children have cut contact with him, his previous wife died from cancer, and his mum also died. He drinks just about every night and gets very angry when he does, but often gets angry even without alcohol.   Every night he takes his anger out on my mum, verbally abusing her to the point of tears, often threatening to cut off the electricity, internet, water, money etc which he pays for. He shows absolutely no love for her and often gets her to the point that she starts hitting herself because she feels trapped. She has even cut her wrists because of the stuff he does to her, and often mentions to me that she feels like she just wants to die. My stepdad has also told her to go kill herself multiple times.   I have stepped in on a few occasions, and it revolves in hard stepping up very close to me as if he is about to hit me, and often shouts horrible words at me as well. I am able to protect myself as I have been going to the gym and am definitely strong enough to fight him off if it comes to that. But my mum is a lot smaller than him and I fear for her safety.   My mum says he has never hit her, but he has almost broken her finger trying to grab something from her, shoved her back causing her to sprain her ankle, shoved her off the bed while she was holding the dog, and torn her clothes while she is wearing them.   I go back to my dads every second week, and I feel afraid to leave her alone with him, and I always worry that she is going to cut herself again, although I feel that she__ only still here because of me and my brother, who support her as much as we can.   I could go into so much more detail here but I think I have made my point, I am going into year 12 next year and I am not going to be able to do it with the constant fighting, loud noises and fear for my mums safety. I have recorded a few videos of the things he says, but that is about all. No one in our extended family knows of the stuff he does.   I am just looking for advice as to how I can help my mum, as I don__ know how I can help her. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and if anyone has been in a similar situation please tell me about it i__ all ears :),   Thank you everyone and sorry for the essay."

physical,Girlfriend has been extremely physically abusive toward me. How to disengage (very long),"Started off in Late 2019 in what I thought was a good relationship, things went really well between us really connected, we made future plans. In April we moved in together, and I really helped her a lot with her life. She just came out of what she claimed was an abusive relationship and divorce (7 year arranged marriage). I was helping her exercise and lose weight, and I'd catch her lying on these stupid things that nobody should lie about (going into my medications and taking some vitamin). I'd talk about how lying to each other is totally unacceptable. Lying upsets me. I'd put my heart and soul into motivating her like when she had trouble with a job (arguing with some guy), I helped her see the bigger picture and develop strategies. She used to scream louder than anyone could ever imagine to the point where all the neighbors could hear, and it got me worried and super rattled. She also had this pattern of packing her bags whenever we had a disagreement. I wasn't used to this, and talked to her about it, the screaming kept intensifying. I cared about her and I thought it had to do with trauma in her abuse, but still it was hard for me to say ""you need to leave"" and stick by it because I cared about her and us. Physical abuse slowly creeped in, at first it was throwing stuff at me, or trying to slap me. Though by September it devolved into a pattern, she'd point her finger at me and yell, and then swing at me when we were having a disagreement. She'd blame me for everything wrong in her life.  The day after I recognized she needed a life saving surgery and got her to the ED (I'm a medical professional), she gave me a black eye, punched and scratched my back. A few days later she did the same thing. Only thing I did was hold her hands so she couldnt hit me. It felt so bad and dehumanizing to be in this situation, having to hold my partner like this. I thought what has my life become?       One time at the mall, she was arguing aggressively with a cashier because she couldn't make an online return. Probably would have gotten called security on her, so i stepped in and said ""look she cant do the return I'll take care of it by phone easily"". She saw me as my ex-husband and started berating me in public. I told her ""you're acting like a (bitter) divorced women"". Her reaction? Run around the mall and scream like someone was murdering her. It was so gross. I calmly tried to talk to her, and people at the mall saw her screaming and automatically assumed I was some sort of aggressor. I remained incredibly calm the entire time and patient, even after talking to mall security. By this point I've spent numerous occasion working with her to understand the root of her behavior, why we can't raise kids in violence, and how this hurts us and breaks the trust. All these months of yelling wore down on me and even though I was for the most part calm, it became hard not to yell and isolate myself.   In october she threw a plate at my laptop, and cracked the trackpad in an argument. She thankfully replaced that. In November, she got mad at me and treated me like garbage for asking her to assist me with something, and because she wanted to rush me so we could go out and do something. I tried to talk through this it got nowhere. She kept putting down my masculinity and insisting she was right, and insulting me. It bothered me so much I woke up in the middle of the night, and was so angry and frustrated I told her to just get out. She sits on the bed and starts yelling and swearing at me, and I say no. Just pack the bags and leave. I help her pick up one suitcase and she locks me out of the guest house naked and calls the cops. I have to run to the main house and find a spare key, and get dressed. We both said there was no physical abuse, but wow that was scary. I could have had my life ruined.     In January, she finds out she accidentally didnt renew her visa, and I say that if we cant be together physically ever, we can't continue this relationship, but I'll help you get it filled. That night I had a hamburger I kissed her as a joke (she's hindu), and she comes over to kiss me on the eye. I put my  tongue in her mouth to make out as usual, and she bites through my tongue. All the way through I could feel my finger on both sides of my tongue. Im incredibly freaked out but I keep very quiet because my elderly parents are around and they dont need more stress. I tell her to just go. Shoot what am I going to do? I go over with her and called her a bad word and she kicks and punches me. I go upstairs and pace back and forth. I look at my tongue and I'm freaked because it looks really bad.  I keep thinking about next steps.      I go back to where my parents, and I go over to my mom and quietly pull her aside and ask her to take a look without explaining, then I slowly explain what happened. About halfway through girlfriend comes over and says ""I knew you'd fucking tell them because you're a momma's boy pussy"". My mom says something, and girlfriend gets this evil look in her eyes and charges toward my mom with her fist raised and says ""I will kill you"". I of course got between them, so nothing would happen. Got gf out of the house. shes on the lawn and waiting by the front door with a psychotic look in her eyes, and i'm trying to keep my parents safe from her. Who knows what shes going to do? I have her come with me to the ER to address the mistake she made and shes treating me like garbage the entire time. The Doc says I dont need stitches, and her response ""That's all? what a waste of time. I bet you wanted to manipulate me"".  I couldn't believe it.  She also sends my parents some threatening texts about how she'll never leave the house.     At this point, I'm just trying to get her out of the house as step 1 of closing this chapter on her, which I do manage to do after a trip to atlanta. I was still blinded my feelings, and I did help her move out into a new place. She gets even more manipulative and cunning though throwing me out after I take a sleeping medicine (putting my life in dangerous) because i bring up going to play golf with my parents the next day calmly. She throws me out and then tells me later that she called an emergency psychiatrist and felt suicidal because I left. She decides to make a one way flight to india in mid march and at this point I'm just slowly ebbing away contact from her. She claims she'll come back and wants me to come to marry her, but I'm never doing that.  She keeps trying to crawl back in my life after she did this, trashed me to her entirely family, and part of me is worried that she will come up with a bogus story of physical abuse against me (she has also hit herself in the head and nose during arguments really hard, and I had to stop her from doing that).    She has absolutely no remorse for any of the times she hit me, none of the discussions we had mattered because she did the same physical abuse on christmas, and she never took accountability for what she did to my mom. She justifies everything she does in her mind, and twists everything around. She also created an environment of terror at my own house for months, where I was honestly afraid to come home, and what she would do next.  I've known I've deserved better than this, but I really loved and trusted this girl for far too long. What should I do? I'm really hoping she'll just leave and never come back."
emotional,A humidifier.....,"Started with a conversation about me wanting a humidifier....ffs....shouldn't be the end of the world. Shit like this idk what even happens any more. Now I've been sitting here considering the implications of a bullet in my head. It shouldn't be like this. I'm glad my kids have more than I did growing up. I really do. But holy hell, at what cost?"

emotional,Coming out of crises mode - we left and our world has imploded multiple directions. Where to go next?,"The below has emotional abuse, attempted suicide, and family.   Looking for advice or experience on how to help my kids cope. What type of support groups should I think about?  Ive been with my husband for 25 years and we have an 18 and 14 yo daughters.  He is emotionally abusive, constantly changes the rules. I tested him early in our relationship, because I had no self worth I allowed it. And he was quite intimidating as well.  There have been arguments where we both have threatened leaving, but never did it.   On 11/19 we did. There was an incident, he couldn__ find a wrench and blamed one of the kids for losing it and berated us all day. It was the straw that broke...but it broke 3 times. My 18 yo daughter informed me that night she had a plan to leave. I also made the decision I have to go with my other daughter. I can__ lose both.  My husband loses it. Faces consequences he never knew existed. Had no idea where the kid it__ hard to detach from is.   Take 2 - the next night I still refuse to come home. I get a text from his sister (who is supporting me and trying to get him to give us space). She says she is going to bed, but will be texting him to check in as he has been suicidal. I call him. No answer. A couple hours later he calls and says he swallowed pills, called ambulance. He won__ let them in, and they won__ force entry since __uicide isn__ illegal_ and they have to protect themselves (which I totally get but did not expect in that moment of crises). My 14 yo is with me. I have to make the decision to leave him.  My 18 yo blames herself. 4 hours later he wakes up puking and calls the ambulance.  The next day he goes to live with a friend as we figure things out.   Take 3 - the next night my 18 yo comes home with me and my 14 yo.  That night 18 yo goes into trauma shock/dissociative state. Can__ talk, can__ walk, covers eyes, hyperventilating, all limbs are flailing. After 3 hours we go to hospital.  I call my husband and he meets us there. They exam and give meds for calming.   We are following up with all kinds of therapists for everyone and have already had appointments. My husband started meds. We__e established boundaries.   The kids are ok with him being in the house as long as the boundaries are in place.  And I__ off of work for now and trying so hard not to break myself. Thankfully I do have a great therapist, but we are 3000 miles from family."
physical,Forced abortion and then physical abuse. Blames me,"The fight all started over him telling me to cut off 4 of my/our friends out of absolutely nowhere. He was ranting and raving and threatening them. He spit on my face, punched a cabinet, then grabbed his assault rifle. I threw my body on the case to stop him from getting it open, he violently tried to get me off the case to get to the gun which left me covered in bruises. He was in a rage, he didn__ even seem human. He then fled with the gun in his car and I tried to get In the car to stop him driving off and killing himself, he physically threw me out of it and then floored the accelerator from a standstill and veered the car hard into the road so I was thrown from the vehicle and about to go under tires when my neighbor came out of his house screaming for him to stop. He said __ knew you just wanted to ruin my life and get me in trouble with the cops._ Of course I didn__ want to, so I tried to protect him with the police so his military career would not be affected. Afterwards I would gently ask that he acknowledge and get help (discreetly) for the physical abuse and threats of suicide. He said he__ divorce me if I used the word abuse and denied or blamed me for what happened that night. We had been married just 3 weeks. He had to go away for work for two weeks and was acting so cruel and remorseless and telling me not to talk to anyone about it or we wouldn__ be able to work things out.. I decided not to speak to him while he was gone for work for 10 days, and after just 3 days of some half hearted attempts to reach me he reactively filed for divorce to hurt me, to try to control the narrative (that if I said anything about that night it was because I was vindictive and angry about him filing for divorce), but he didn__ tell me he filed. The day he filed, I also received anonymous gifts from him in the mail. I am devastated. There was another instance of cruelty last year (forced abortion- during pandemic on my 36th birthday for a child we both wanted and then he changed his mind- horrific) but after 6 months apart he got help and took full accountability and it really helped me heal. Now this.  Thankfully I had spoken to a victim advocacy program in the military and decided to unrestrict my report so they could do a full investigation. The evidence is overwhelming. He will then be mandated into treatment and will also likely be separated from the army and possibly charged. I want to work things out once he had treatment and hopefully gets a diagnosis (BPD? NPD? CPTSD for sure). But he will probably hate me for ruining his life. Help."
emotional,"What is it called when someone clearly didn't give a fck about me, but when I stopped talking to them, they blamed me for hurting their feelings?","The friendship was all close and fun when I was up and well, entertaining and helpful. In fact, I was helpful even when I was battling depression.  But as soon as I needed them for something that took minimal effort from their part, while I was battling a month long episode of depression, they left me stranded. They didn't say no so I could take care of it myself; they said yes and never made it happen, and never said sorry or even explain when they saw me end up fending for myself with exactly the thing they agreed to help with.  I stopped talking to them. It's not really a choice; I have always sucked at pretending to be diplomatic when I'm done with someone. I either have a real relationship where I care about the other person to the moon and back, or I'll consider them non-existent in my life. There's no in-between.  In their opinion, what they did *plus* the fact that they did it during one of my lowest points despite me always being there for them *even* during my lowest points *doesn't make it OK* for me to stop talking to them like that. And they demanded that I *at least say hello*. Because how I behaved made them feel like they were a bad person while in fact they are a good person.  This messes with my head badly, and I know I have every right in the world to not talk to whomever I see fit, but I don't know how to name what they are doing to me?"
emotional,I feel so low and alone from it all.,"The last conversation I had with the abusive guy I dated, he was talking to me like I wasn't even a human being, saying the most heinous shit to me. He had been emotionally/psychologically abusive and sexually abusive to me before, but never directly verbally abusive, but this time he was openly insulting me and telling me how little of a shit he gave about me. I still can't get over his tone of voice, he had absolutely no remorse whatsoever. None. It didn't seem like he felt even remotely bad for saying the things he was saying to me, and they just got more and more cruel the more the conversation went on. He acted like I deserved it somehow, saying that my behavior is what caused this. He talked to me like I was an insect he wanted to squash, and anything I said would just be used to insult me further. This conversation was the morning after we had sex and he coldly rushed me out of his apartment.   It was the first time I truly saw him as a fucking evil monster. In the past, I had viewed him as toxic and abusive, but complicated. But this time it was just abusive. Purely cruel. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities in him.   When he psychologically abused me (mainly gaslighting and manipulation) I would have the worst fucking panic attacks because I didn't know what was true and what wasn't. He would say/do something right in front of my eyes and then later insist it never happened or that I just misinterpreted it. He would make me feel like I was crazy for having the thoughts that I did, even though they were 100% true. I once passed out in the shower and woke up on the bathroom floor with my legs/back covered in bruises because I was so exhausted by the panic attacks and anxiety of his mistreatment.   Sometimes I wish he would've just hit me to make me realize how bad he was sooner. The worst part of it is, I was already an abuse/trauma survivor before meeting him, so when he would blame his actions on me, some small part of me believed him. I'm already so prone to believing that everything that happens around me is my fault. And I think he picked up on that and used it to his advantage.   This experience was just a couple days ago. I have virtually no support system (something else that made me a target for his abuse I'm sure) and I feel so alone with this pain."
physical,Setback. Struggling.,"The last week I had been doing really good.   Does anyone on here ever just want to make their ex abuser suffer? Like.... once you start coming out of the fog, you just want to ruin their entire life? Because you are *so* sick of them getting away with everything?  For the entire first month I was trying to protect him. Help him. I hurt myself because I gave his case a pretty great chance to get overturned and, now, for the last week, I have been kicking myself SO hard over that. I heard from him for the first time last week since his arrest, and he was just a total vindictive monster. He tried to use all these manipulation tactics that I saw straight through.   Tonight, I found out he got his own place. This man is damn near 30 and had never had his own place before with me. His Dad had this insane power over him.... &amp; anyway. Initially, I thought that he had been locked away at his Dads, and was under his Dads control, &amp; he felt like he couldn__ come home. Over time, we both determined we will never take each other back (indirect comments.) However- today I discovered he has his own place. This completely *blind-sighted* me because of various reasons. This guy has his own place and never reached out to me. Never asked to have me over. He__ off just living his life as if all the promises he ever made to me and the life we invested into each other meant nothing.

When we were broken up before and he was still staying at a room we shared together with old roommates, within less than a month he was already having other girls over and sleeping around. So of course he is now with his own place. Doesn__ matter though. He probably was already having girls in at his Dads house. I remember one time he asked me to meet him there when his Dad hates me &amp; I was literally __arred_ from being there thinking he was a lunatic. That thought and the way he treated me through all this is what confirmed for me I__ never take him back if he ever came back around because he__ so gross like that. I have no doubts he__ already seeing whoever he wants which is why I__e already been doing my best to be proactive and move forward on that front myself.

I don__ want to do anything out of anger I really don__. I__ trying to survey my emotions. But I honest to God think at this point I don__ care if he was sentenced, went to jail or even died off the face of the earth.   This guy has ruined me. &amp; I think it__ time I balls up, call the victim impact coordinator and tell her I do want to testify. Contact the arresting officer and ask what we can do and if he would still like the pictures since he will be arguing the case on my behalf. I can__ stand for this anymore. I can__ stand for him to be able to just go on with his life. I don__ care that it__ not with me, I really don__. Yes that still hurts but it__ less about that and more about keeping him from destroying other people the way he__ done to me.   He doesn__ deserve an easy road. Period.   I don__ know. Clearly I__ writing this emotionally because just two days ago I was thinking I wanted to do anything to avoid court. I__ appreciate any honest input. Does anyone else feel like they couldn__ care less of their ex died in a car wreck or fire? I__ just at that point and I__ kind of upset even at the fact that he__ making me feel that way!

emotional,I am still doubting myself months later.,"The nature of the abuse I endured was masterfully covert. To this day, I believe her when she says she had good intentions.  It was a really wonderful relationship in my eyes. I just thought I lacked nuance and insight when it came to emotions and communicating to someone who is highly sensitive. My reactions and words and tone were always heavily scrutinized, but I still feel that maybe she was right. I always ask people what impression she left them with; it__ usually something about control or projecting an image. My family says I was safeguarding her emotions and babysitting her from day one. We were together for nearly 5 years.  I know for a fact that I was emotionally abused, because there is nothing normal about how long it is taking me to regain my footing compared to how she has dealt with it so far.  Everyone tells me I was emotionally abused. Friends, family, strangers, therapists, doctors. There is a nagging feeling that I am not being objective enough and I am purposely portraying her as an abuser to protect myself from the shame of how the relationship ended. She said this herself; if I were really telling the full story, people would have more compassion for her.  Has anybody recovered from emotional abuse that only became obvious once you opened up to others and the trauma bond began to break? How long did it take? I feel like I__ losing my fucking mind. I miss her and love her so much."
emotional,Am I being emotionally abused?,"The thing is, I__e always had relatively healthy relationships. I am a bit of a push over, I can admit that. I hate letting people down, and I suffer from anxiety.   I met a guy (27) online a few months ago during lockdown.  Exchanged numbers.  Talked.  Flirted.  I liked him, for what it was worth, being virtual.  Then he wanted to get a little more.. flirty.  So, I did- no pictures, from me, though.  And one night I didn__ want to.  He said it made him anxious, so I had to.  Red flag.  I told him I no longer wanted to do that. He respected it, even though it didn__ make him happy.   I changed my mind about him here. Making me do things is NOT okay.   Then, he sent me my location randomly.  I became scared. Scared of his abilities. Was he stalking me?   So I continued to talk to him. Texting only. No calls or FaceTime ever. I just wanted to keep him calm.   He began knowing my schedule.  He would get angry if it took me longer to get home from certain places.  When I started seeing my friends, he told me to tell them to just go home, or he__ get mad if I didn__ text him constantly.  Eventually, I told him I can__ text a lot when I__ with my friends and he decided to give me 20 minutes of free time. Every 20 minutes, he texts to check in what I__ doing.  He wanted to come visit me in August, but I told him I didn__ want him to; that I just wanted to be friends.  He got angry, saying I__ putting up unnecessary walls, that I am wrong in the way I think.. but he will wait.  So time goes on.  He makes me text him every morning.  If I don__ say __ood morning_, he__ angry and passive aggressive about it.  I have to say goodnight, too. And text him the second I__ done with work or running errands. I have to tell him when I leave and when I return.  If I don__, he becomes frustrated, telling me he only asks because he cares and I act like it__ more than that.  But it feels like I__ a prisoner! I can__ breathe, go anywhere or just sit on my couch and relax without telling him. I have 20 minutes and then I have to update.  He also began to do EVERYTHING I do. Eat everything I eat. Agree with everything I say.   So a few weeks ago I told him again that I am not interested, after he said my behavior is weird (not being very chatty).  So he told me that it__ my fault that we are just friends, and that he still wants to meet me one day to see where we could go. He even said he takes no blame for the way I feel.  I told him that I feel like he still has hope and he told me he doesn__ see how I think that... it__ pretty clear.  So now, he is texting even more, longer, even. He thinks because I told him I__e been quiet because the fact don__ see him that way, means he can somehow change my mind because we have *amazing* chemistry. No. We. Don__.   He can__ take rejection.  He thinks I__ his.  And he does own me anymore.  I can__ sleep.  I can__ check my phone without shaking from anxiety attacks thinking that he may lecture me, stalk me or yell at me, or demean me.  I can__ relax with friends because I know I have to check in soon.   And I__ terrified of him and what he will do if I block him.   And if I meet someone, he will probably think I__ being disloyal to HIM even though we aren__ dating, and I fear revenge.   I cry every night regretting that got myself into this.  I have so much shame and guilt.   So here__ my question.   Am I being emotionally abused by a stranger via texting? Or am I just causing my own pain? :("
emotional,What to do when you tell you partner what he is saying is gaslighting and in return he tells you to not allow yourself to be gaslight?,"The title pretty much explains it.  My partner and I have known each other for 14 years, we have been on and off during all these years.  Yesterday evening he spoke to me rudely on the phone which really disappointed me, I told him that it bothered me. He went off at me again saying he does not see an issue in what he said, called me stupid and projected it all back on me. I explained to him that the phrases he was using were perfect examples of gaslighting, in return he told me ""then dont allow yourself to be gaslight"".   I am beginning to realise that I am to blame because I let these things happen to me."

emotional,Am I having an anxiety\panic attack?,"This has happened for a long time already for a few years  I used to think it was my body__ way of __e-stressing_  They__e all silent. My heart beats really fast and it__ some of the only times I actually can do clearly feel it beating. I used to deal with it by lying on my bed and __etting go_; no fan no air movement in general;  afterwards I always feel..like I can__ really move properly? I much rather keep staying there, I feel sluggish and distorted when I get up and move again. And usually (as I have kinda a busy life and holds more responsibility as the __olden child_ of the house, I essentially __ut off_ the panic attacks? If that makes sense. Like I just suppress it and let my heart beat away, and I feel something stuck in my throat. Even now as I__ typing this I feel it. In worse cases it feels so __tuck_ it__ as if it__ hard to breathe.  I usually space out (then again I space out a lot in general) but then it feels I can__ __et back in_(?) I can still function normally and have a high-energy exterior, talk, laugh etc. but I rather just go quiet, when it__ less manageable; though sometimes, I still have to carry on so I can__ do that. Long story short the family and society in general doesn__ quite..accept __xcuses_ as such and mental health in general doesn__ have much exposure as of today where I am, either having very stereotypical understandings of it or don__ believe disorders exist. (Things have been progressing in general though~!)  Sometimes I can only just guess what triggered it, there are plausible factors but not sure. As of now maybe it__ because all of the exams and online school in general, next week we__e going back to school for the first in a very long time and knowing how it is the teachers likely will pick on us. We__e getting all our marks next week to and let__ just say..my parents are hard to satisfy no matter what mark I get.  I__ not the surest on what to do about it. Usually I would (and always have been) sucking it up, it__ really not Too bad; but I__ open in hearing thoughts; even if they might not be an option as of now it can maybe help me work towards it in the future.  Sorry if this was sorta messy heh  Take care, all__"
physical,Was I in the wrong for trying to jump out of a moving car ?,"This incident happened on 1/27/21 . I will never forget that day.   My brother and I had decided to go out grocery shopping by our car. He was in a bad mood so he reversed the car into a wall and broke one of the rear view mirrors. This irritated me.  I got into the car and started volunteering to drive myself if he was in a bad mood. He said no. We continued moving till we reached the main road with traffic. I was fuming and fretting all this while. Our father is also an angry driver. So my brother's stress was rubbing off on me.   When we reached the main road , I suddenly remembered the time my father oversped a car with me in it , just to make me reach school on time. All the way , he kept blaming mefor his rash driving. I could only sit and cry silently at my fate of being forced tostay in an overspeeding vehicle with an abusive parent. This memory came back in that moment with my brother on the wheel.  I started to panic and started repeatedly telling him to stop the car. He told me that the mirro braking incident was over and done with, and I should come with him to the grocery store. I repeated myself and started crying a little too while saying stop the car , stop the car. This angered my brother even more. He turned into a quite alley , where I opened my car door and tried to get out of the moving vehicle. My shoes screeching on the road. He scratched my right arm with his nails , tugged very hard at my black t shirt and finally punched me in between my eyes on the t-zone , breaking one lens of my spectacles.   I cried and wailed and panicked even more. All this while saying "" you can't force me ; youtore my t shirt "".   He finally stopped at another alley after this one, after I told him my purse had fallen out.  I got out and walked back home the same route. I realised my bag had fallen out when I tried to get out of the car. A very kind construction worker had kept my muddied purse safely at his hut. (I am in India) .  I collected the purse , thanked him and walked back home sobbing endlessly .  Am I the asshole for trying to get out of a moving car ? My brother and I confronted each other after , with our mother standing in between us. I screamed gibberish at him till I lost my voice and even broke a glass bottle in my rage. The heated argument ended with him having to leave the house for one night. He went to his girlfriend's , but she refused to let him in. He stayed in a hotel instead.  Am I the asshole in this situation? Any insight into this would be very helpful ..."
physical,Do I even have the right to be mad? (Mental health issues as an explanation for abusive behavior),"This is going to be a really long one, but if anyone can stick with it, I__ really appreciate it.   (Some background information: I__ transgender female-to-male and had been struggling a long time with my sexuality)  I dated a guy (we__l call him Michael) for 11 months. I knew going into the relationship that he identified as asexual and I was fine with that. A little while into the relationship, Michael told me that he was a survivor of sexual assault and had PTSD. He told me his triggers, and I made sure to avoid them at all costs. A few months into the relationship, Michael expressed that he was interested in trying sexual things with me. We went slow _ I made sure I never pressured him to do anything he didn__ want to, I avoided his triggers, and frequently checked to see if everything was alright. Everything was going fine _ sometimes he__ get upset or overwhelmed, but we__ stop immediately and I__ always be there to comfort him. Eventually he got a lot more comfortable with sex so it happened more often. Then the end of the semester came (we__e both in college), and he began getting really stressed.   He was in crisis just about every day. I tried to be there for him whenever he was upset, but it was becoming extremely taxing on me and my own mental health. It got to the point that I couldn__ take it anymore, so I told him I was feeling extremely emotionally worn out and asked him to find someone else to talk to about his issues. He apologized, but he didn__ stop. In fact, it got worse. The smallest thing could send him into deep self loathing to the point that I was extremely afraid of saying anything that might set him off. He had hurt himself in front of me before, so I was always afraid of what he might do if I spoke up about how basically being his therapist was affecting me.  Needless to say, I was more than relieved when summer cam around and I could go back to my home all the way across the country. Over the summer, I finally started passing as male. I also started to realize that I didn__ feel comfortable with the romantic side of my relationship with Michael and came out to him as aromantic. He agreed to stop doing very overtly romantic things in order to make me more comfortable. However, he didn__ stop _ he kept doing things that I was uncomfortable with, becoming inconsolable when I__ confront him, and telling me that it was his depression/PTSD that was making it hard for him to remember. I figured that I couldn__ be angry with him since it was his mental illness and was beyond his control, so I just sucked it up and didn__ say anything about it again.   Summer ended and I went back to school for the fall. A month or two later, I realized I was also very uncomfortable with the sexual side of our relationship as well and ended up I coming out to him as asexual. We agreed that we__ have more of a dedicated partnership than a romantic relationship and that we wouldn__ do anything else sexual because I told him I was extremely uncomfortable with it.   But again, even though he was a sexual assault survivor who was always pushing consent, he didn__ stop sexual advances. It would start gradually enough that I wouldn__ realize until it was too late (for example, we__ be laying down with each other in bed and suddenly I__ realize his hands were where I didn__ want them to be). At this point, I wanted to say no, but then I__ remember how he had banged his head against the wall as self-punishment and thought he didn__ deserve to live for forgetting to turn on the fan above the stove _ what would he do if I told him he had done something sexual to me without his consent? Or implied that he had done the same thing that the person who assaulted him did? He had told me from the beginning of the relationship that that was his greatest fear.   So, afraid of what he might do to himself if I spoke up, I just let it happen. I__ even comfort him afterwards when he__ get upset and tell me that he hadn__ even wanted to do it. It made absolutely no sense to me since I had asked for us to stop doing sexual things for an indefinite amount of time and now here I was, having to comfort him after he had gone ahead with sex anyways and then claimed he never wanted to do it in the first place. This happened a few times, and I blamed myself for having somehow probably pressured him _ why else would he have done it? He was asexual after all, right? Anyways, I ended up breaking up with him after winter break when I realized that I wasn__ aromantic or asexual, I just liked women instead of men (at one point in my life liking women was considered gay since I was living as a girl, so bad reactions from others had pushed me to believe I was bisexual).   I blocked Michael on every social media platform I could think of, but ended up confronting him through tumblr messaging, telling him what he had done to me and the damage it had caused. He replied by saying __ was trapped in my worst memories, and it made it hard to remember where I was, who I was with, what was talked about_.   Now I__ trying to figure out how much he can really be held accountable for what he did. On one hand, he created an environment where saying no could be dangerous and he also initiated sex after I had withdrawn consent indefinitely. On the other hand, he had severe mental health issues. I__ struggling to figure out if I__ allowed to put the blame on him and how much his mental health issues made it so that it really wasn__ his fault.   So basically, is he still to blame even if his mental health issues made him forget all those things? Or is it even possible that depression, PTSD, or OCD can make you forget things like that? (For context, he was still able to do fine in classes and didn__ seem extremely mentally impaired)"
physical,My mom__ abuser was arrested,"This is going to be scattered, it__ been a long 48 hours. But we__e finally getting out. I (22) watched my dad throw shoes at my mom and it was caught on video. I called the cops and he was arrested. This was the culmination of years (if not decades) of manipulation, verbal abuse, gaslighting, digital abuse, and sleep deprivation, and I think that was the push my mom needed to file for divorce. My mom, my younger siblings, and I are getting free from him and the fear we__e all been living in. He__ trying to scramble to get her back by offering to go to marriage counseling but that ship sailed so long ago. My mom is ready to get out now and she has 6 kids that need a better environment than the one he was creating at home. I__ proud of myself for calling 911, I__ proud of my mom for getting out, I__ proud of my siblings for being so smart and helpful. This is the beginning of the beginning for us"
emotional,My dad blamed me for my dog dying,"This is something that I will never forget that he said to me. I still feel guilty to this day. This is also not the only time he said something like this.   I was a junior in High school and it was spring time, I was asked to clean the floors in the kitchen so I did. I cleaned it with wood polish because they were hardwood floors.  I did not  know that wood polish makes it slippery.  I had 2 dogs (molly and Maggie)at the time and they liked to chase each other. On a Sunday,Right after cleaning the floors the 2 dogs were chasing each other, molly slipped and hurt her paw. She was limping but it went away after Tuesday. On Wednesday, she stopped eating completely and was throwing up and had explosive diarrhea. She was only drinking water but then would throw it up minutes after. My parents don__ like taking the pets to the vet unless it__ an absolute emergency. We started giving her chicken broth just to give her something. By Friday, she was so weak she wouldn__ even drink anything voluntarily. Next day I had finally convinced my mom to take Molly to the vet. Of course, it was a Saturday and only the emergency hospital were open. They didn__ do much, they gave her IV fluids and some pain meds and sent her home with us. She looked better for a couple hours, then started to go downhill fast. After a week, I started to realize that I might be losing my best friend. So I started to process that I had a couple of days left. So on Tuesday, I remember coming home from school, she did get up to say hello like she always did. I found her on the floor, I could still tell she was excited to see me because I saw her tail barely move. I gave her some pain meds and went up to take a nap. My mom was on the phone trying to feed her broth when she realized that Molly stopped breathing.   The only thing my dad said was__his is why you don't clean the floor with polish._ then proceeded to tell me that I was a disappointment to him. He also told everyone on social media that it was my fault."

physical,Finally left him for good tonight,"This is the 4th split up but needs to be the final one. He is beset by personality disorders. I believe he has NPD with some BPD traits, ADHD plus autism.   He is obsessed by BPD &amp; all his ex's are crazy &amp; he has tried to pin BPD on me.  I used to live with him but after a police incident in Sept, I left &amp; moved back to my home city an hour from him. We did get talking again &amp; started dating but he has got more &amp; more abusive &amp; the relationship such as it was - was going nowhere.  He enjoys playing the victim &amp; even now he will be saying he has been dumped by me before Xmas &amp; what a bitch I am. It will probably be to get out of working shifts because he will be so ""heart broken"" - if only he actually had a heart. He has a rock instead.  He is a psychopath who hates women. He has abused all his ex's &amp; he should never be allowed to date another woman. I reported incidents of abuse to the police but unfortunately there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him.   He has since been more abusive but it seems very hard to get anything to stick &amp; at the very least get him arrested &amp; cautioned. Certainly I felt the police force where I lived with him, totally let me down &amp; failed to recognise that he was coercivelly controlling me"
physical,Advice Needed: Vulnerable Mother and Children in Southend (UK),"This is the first time I__e had to actively handle a situation like this, as I__e never interacted with social services in my own abuse experiences, so any help would be greatly appreciated. I don__ know what the procedures are like. There are plenty of gaps to the situation which I__ unable to fill at the moment. I may be able to get more information, but given the circumstances, it won__ be much.   A family friend is concerned about her sister, nephew and niece__ wellbeing. Let__ call her sister Sara. She leaves in Southend-on-Sea. Her daughter is six years old and her son is around ten months old.   Sara and her children are home bound because of her abusive husband. Amidst the physical and mental domestic abuse, the children are also at risk. I don__ know if the children are physically assaulted, but it__ a possibility, and the social services are aware that he__ made threats in the past to kill the children.   How much the social services are aware of, I__ not sure, but they__ intervened at one point. Sara was manipulated by her in-laws into letting her husband return home, as they __pologised_ on his behalf.   The last letter sent by social services is dated 24/04/2020, that I__l paraphrase here: __e__e aware your husband will be discharged from hospital [mandatory mental health evaluation per request of social services] and if he returns to live at your home address, it__ your responsibility to keep the children safe. If we receive any further referrals raising concerns about your two children, we will be doing enquiries and unannounced home checks_.   This is some of what she__ dealing with now: she can__ leave the house, has little to no communication with the outside world (her daughter has a tablet, and they somehow contact her sister outside, but this is very limited), food is minimal (they aren__ allowed to cook or even be in the kitchen, and are given leftovers), if she__ on the phone to her mother (who lives overseas) her husband is there with her, so she can__ say anything about the abuse, and she is physically assaulted.   Please be aware that there__ also a language barrier and technology barrier here, so accessing information on domestic abuse etc. online is difficult. She__ also rightfully scared of making plans to escape, so simply packing a bag and leaving isn__ possible.   Having checked Southend__ council services, I__e seen that the children__ social services take referral calls if someone suspects abuse, so I decided I__ call them on Monday and relay that Sara and her children need to get out immediately. The information online is somewhat confusing though. My questions are as follow:  1. With the lockdown situation, is the option of social services visiting out of the question? Would it be further delayed, even though they__e at risk?   2. Can she legally leave with the children? Is there any issue with this?  3. If she__ unable to get a hold of her own personal documents, such as her passport, would social services or the police be able to get them/ accompany her as she collects them?  4. Is there a way to instigate a welfare check, if this is available in Southend? Would the police be able to remove her and the children from there?  5. Whilst my call to social services concerns the children, what would be done about Sara? Should I be making a separate call elsewhere, for vulnerable adults dealing with domestic abuse?  I__ not entirely sure but I believe Sara would want to go to her sister__ house, in East London. I don__ even think she could call the police by herself, as she has no access to a phone (he broke it and destroyed the SIM card), so if the call came from someone else, would they help immediately or would there be a process delaying this?   If I find out anything else, I__l update this post. Thank you."
emotional,[vent] I__ pretty sure that this is why I__ heavily dependent while being 19.,"This is the second day that my mother argued and got upset with me over me trying to help her move stuff out of the way to clear the room better.

physical,How__ this supposed to work?,"This last weekend, my moms fianc_© threatened me and I had it recorded so I went to the police. I had a 72 hour restraining order against him which ends tonight. This fight happened because I was defending my mom and yet she is giving him one more chance. I feel betrayed by my mother but I have absolutely nowhere else to live. I was going to get a permanent restraining order on him. I__ going in tomorrow for assistance.  But, how my mother can give this man a second chance after what he said is crazy.

emotional,Anyone else have a habit of lying/hiding things from people as a trauma response?,"This might actually be quite a toxic trait, although I__e taken on this habit from all the emotional abuse as a child/growing up - my brain has learned to ALWAYS be terrified of the outcome if I tell the truth or open up about something to anyone. Mainly due to all the times in the past I__ be honest with my parents/toxic friends about something, or make a simple mistake, and in return be harshly punished/experience major conflict which caused me trauma that still affects me today. It__ made me lose so many friendships because they deem me untrustworthy, and not a true friend because I hide too much from them, even pointless things. But it__ simply programmed into my brain to do anything I can to avoid upsetting people, I__ SO scared of conflict, even if the person is kind and understanding overall, the thought of arguing or upsetting people is so horrifying to me, that I can__ bring myself to be honest most of the time?"
physical,"This time, I hit him back","This might make some people angry but it happened. I don__ consider myself an abuser though I__ sure some people will say I am. Which I understand.    My post history has almost no history of what I__e been going through because I__e been deleting most of my posts in this sub after a while, for privacy reasons.    Here__ what happened. It was last week:  My abusive husband__ violence has been escalating over the past year. He was violent before, but this past year he has become merciless. Late February especially, he beat me like never before and since our home belongs to his family, he has been threatening to divorce me (which I would be fine with if I had money) and to kick me out legally. I don__ have a job and each time he made his threats I froze with fear.    A week ago, we argued, he strangled me (as usual now), and he made the most convincing threat of eviction. He told me I had until the end of April to get out. He was riling me up on purpose and scaring me. I was feeling helpless.   It wasn__ even 7am yet and we had just woke up. After he strangled me, I was on the couch and he was standing but was bent over to have his face close to mine while telling I had a little over 30 days to get out. He sounded dead serious about kicking me out and I couldn__ take it anymore. I thought about grabbing his hair but I didn__ want to use violence, because I felt it was useless, and I was fairly sure he would beat the hell out of me again if I tried. He is twice my size, and I was scared. However he continued telling me I__ be homeless, so without thinking, in a swift motion, I suddenly grabbed his hair, pulled him down and punched his face and his back several times.    He has been beating me so much that, unfortunately for him, I now know most of his motions and expected them without thinking, which rendered his attempts at attacking me useless.    I don__ remember what happened because this was pretty out of character for me, so I went back to watch the security footage and apparently I said several time __ou__e going to stop strangling me_ and __ou__e going to stop trying to make me homeless_ and also ____ a goddamn person_. I usually say the latter when I feel most dehumanized by his violence.   After a couple minutes I let him go. We argued for another thirty seconds and then he went to the bedroom. He came back crying, but it wasn__ a cry of physical pain or the upset cry from the argument. It was the same cry I cry after he beats me. A desperate cry after having been so hurt in your pride, in your heart and in your humanity.   I immediately felt like all my anger was gone. I felt vindicated, but I also knew that I didn__ want to treat anyone like this, much less someone I used to love so much.    He was still crying and talking and I tried to justify my actions for a couple of minutes, but then I realized it was stupid. I stopped and I apologized. I saw his eye starting to bruise and gave him an ice pack. He was like __on__ touch me_ and asked me to leave him alone, so I did.    I apologized that morning but also in the afternoon and told him I didn__ want that to happen anymore. I said I wanted to make peace, which he accepted. The cohabitation has been peaceful since. He__ been more patient and nice and I__e been too.    Now I can__ help but think he__ nicer because he got a taste of his own medicine. I also know the peace might not last and he might come back with a vengeance, so I__ careful.    I had to go out several times with bruises on my body and on my face after his beatings, but he__ been refusing to be seen outside the house because of his black eye. Good thing we are in quarantine, but still. He won__ even FaceTime anyone. I told him __ went out many times with bruises you gave me_. He said __hat shouldn__ have happened_ and instead of blaming me for physically abusing me, he finally took most of the blame and told me he did way way worse to me than I did to him, so he deserved what I did to him, which I disagreed with. No one deserves violence.    I felt calmer after hitting him for less than a couple minutes, and I feel so awful for doing that despite the fact that it was once and I did it to someone who has been abusing me for a long time, yet he didn__ hesitate to beat me mercilessly up to three times a day just last month.    Also want to add that I hate this awful thing has made me feel more powerful and gave me back some of my confidence, but as a matter of fact, it did.   I am unable to leave at the moment because of financial situation and also some other personal things, but I__ guessing that__ how people who can finally get out feel. Empowered. Probably a thousand times more confident than I__ feeling right now."
physical,Finding affordable long-term housing for my sister (19 y.o. DV victim),"This situation both enrages and guts me every time I talk about it.

I__ posting here because I__ not sure if I__ in the right, in the wrong_ I don__ want to tell family or friends because I__ so embarrassed. So if anyone will listen, thank you.  My boyfriend and I dated all four years of high school. It was full of ups and downs _ lots of downs.. but I figured we were just immature. I had moved on to a regular relationship after we broke up and wasn__ particularly happy but was treated well. We broke up and my ex and I reconnected. We both decided we were more mature now and things were really awesome. One night I was hopped up on adderal and drinking and wanted to test him and see if he was more open minded before we got together and I flashed my tits at a bouncer for free cover. Not my proudest moment but my girlfriends were doing it too and had boyfriends with them so I figured it wasn__ a big deal. Big mistake. My __x_ got extremely upset, rightfully so, wanted to get away from me and I begged him not to so we stayed together.  Flash forward to today - a year later. Between then and now we have moved in together.  he has had huge blowups on me and blames it on what I did last Halloween (as in that__ why he gets so mad and yells at me). One example argument was that in my memory box I had a birthday card that was given to me by my exes mom that I had forgotten was in there. We were both looking at the box one day and I saw it, took it out and folded it to throw away. He grabbed it out of my hand. Said I was hiding it from him and that it was a red flag, started yelling saying I still had feelings for my ex, started packing his things and saying he was gonna leave me. Once I begged for him to not leave he said I better clear everything out that has to do with my ex because if he finds something else he__ leaving. Everything was cleared months ago so I didn__ have to clear anything else.  This weekend I was at my moms birthday. I was worried my boyfriend was gonna be upset about traffic on the way back home so I kept asking him when we should leave. He wouldn__ give me a straightforward answer and there was a lot of people around so I was a bit stressed so I looked at him and said __ou__e upsetting me_ and then said to everyone __e__e going to go now_. We left and we when got in the car he told me I was volatile and unhinged for blurting out that we were leaving. He started getting really upset so I was crying and saying that he shouldn__ be so upset with me for that. When I said that he told me I was gaslighting him and making it his fault we left because I was worried he was going to be upset about traffic. We get home, he says he can__ be with someone so volatile and slept on the floor of the living room with all of his clothes on including shoes and flinched any time I got near him to get him to take his shoes off.   We then got into an argument yesterday morning in which he said he wanted to put me in his phone as _10 dollar titties_ and said a lot of other mean stuff, like mentioned how I told him that once a few years ago one of my moms friends hit on me and I didn__ tell her because I didn__ want to start drama and he said I must have been putting off something for them to wanna hit on me. He questioned why I didn__ tell my mom and insinuated that I wanted her friend to hit on me. He then mentioned how I still have feelings for my ex, How I ran off to have a __ollege experience_ and acted like a hoe, how if we broke up all I__ do was go party and be a hoe again, and a lot of other hurtful things.   I told Him that was irrelevant and not helpful and hateful and that I was gonna go stay with my parents for a few days to give him space. I haven__ told my parents that there have been any problems because they warned me about getting back with him and I__ just embarrassed. I__e texted him and called him with no answer. The worst part is that I want it to work out. We__e so compatible when we aren__ arguing and I feel like he__ the love of my life, I__e known him since middle school and I don__ want a life without him in it. We live together and share dogs. I don__ have any friends where I live anymore and don__ live close to any of my family. The whole time I was with my ex I dreamt about him and missed him. I love his family. He has a very kind side and seems to want to be better. I__ just bawling my eyes out because I know it sounds so pathetic and that I should leave. I was watching that show maid and her boyfriend reminded me of him minus the drinking.  Anyways, I guess this was just a rant or something. I__l go back home and we__l both get over it and I__l be happy again. I don__ know.  Edit: oh. And I have his name tattooed on my ass because he said if I got it all of our problems would subside. Yep."
physical,TW? Struck in the face by partner,"Throwaway account + writing on mobile. Initially posted on r/relationships  Me and my boyfriend have been in a relationship just shy of 4 years, during this time I have never experienced any sort of violence. And the relationship have been loving and nice.  However earlier today as he was eating a dessert treat of those types that is creamy with a coat of chocolate. I nudged his arm (intentionally)with the treat twice so that he got cream on his face for fun as a goofy/playful thing. However after the last time of getting cream in his face he slapped me across the face with enough force for it to sting and turn red. (This was done at a friend of his with the friend in the room). I think I yelped and got tears in my eyes immediately after and shortly thereafter left the room and went to the guestroom where we had been staying.  It__ not so much the pain from being struck, but the fact that the person I love and trust most in the whole world would inflict pain on me.  Shortly after I left, he came after me and apologised profoundly and first said he didn__ intend to slap my face but grab my shoulder (both were sitting down) and later changed it to not intending to do it as forcefully as he had. And stressed how he doesn__ want to hurt me intentionally.  A naive part of me wants to believe him, but right now my trust for him is broken and I am struggling to even look at him. However I told him  I might be willing to try(!) and put it behind me if he goes to therapy which he has agreed to. But I don__ know what to think or feel right now. However I think it__ clear to him that if anything like that happens again we are done. But my mind is chaotic and I feel hollow but at the same time it feels like I might burst into tears..  tl;dr been together ~4 years he struck me, I don__ know what to feel or think and he is remorseful. Might put it behind us if he goes to therapy."
emotional,is this anything or am I overthinking?,"title. I__ using a throwaway account to lessen the small chance that I may be found by people who know me. I have no idea if this is an abusive friendship or not, since that seems like a strong word, but I__ asking to make absolutely sure it isn__ (or is, before I start calling it that). I can__ tell if I__ overreacting or not anymore. There__ no way I can make this short, so you__l have to sit through a bit of backstory to all this. Sorry.   &amp;#x200B;  Flash back to 2019, I joined the Amino app and made quick friends with someone there, joined their discord server, all went super well, we were really great friends and got along. But I think, around late 2019-early to mid 2020 was when things got a little strange. I assumed they still cared about me, but they started being unnecessarily rude to me sometimes (like when they were talking about borderline NSFW things in a SFW channel, I asked them to stop as I was getting uncomfortable, they said something like __h it__ just hormones something you clearly don__ have_), that__ the one example I can think of right now. The server it was sent in has since been archived and I have no way of viewing it, so details are a bit fuzzy. There__ more incidences similar to this one and while I can__ remember exact details, later on (closer to the present) they__ constantly mock me over knowing a lot about my favorite games and my favorite characters from the games. They also told me to shut up (followed by a smiley emoji) when I was just talking and they weren__ involved in the conversation much. Again there__ probably more I can__ remember. At a certain point (closer to the present) I couldn__ tell if they liked me anymore, but I stayed just in case they still did, even a little.   &amp;#x200B;  Other friends of mine (and theirs) noticed this and we set up a group chat, the four of us (not including the soon to be ex friend) started talking about these incidences, sort of documenting them. One of the friends, I__l call him X, had a server where the two of them would talk over things, and over time they started to become very clingy to X, with X telling us he felt like the favorite and didn__ want to be that way, also saying how drained they made him feel over their excitement for him. X said that in their shared server, they__ actually been venting out their anger on me for a while now. I__e seen the screenshots of these rants, and they genuinely hurt. I haven__ done anything wrong, yet they go on and on about how much they despise me. But of course, this was all private, so I had no way of knowing unless someone told me.   &amp;#x200B;  We (me and the other 3 friends, though mostly X) have tried to bring this up to them, with little success. When X said he was glad they weren__ online to hurt me, they went all stubborn (for lack of a better word) and assumed everyone hated them and left the server, leaving me in control. (They eventually returned, but everyone else was incredibly confused when it happened.) Later on, last month or so ago, I did attempt to publicly call them out on their actions so other people would know to avoid them. It didn__ work. They found the post and denied everything in it, practically undermining everything said in it (which is basically everything put here). Everyone else in the server agreed with them (I wasn__ in the server, I__ left, but a friend was there and sent screenshots.), and they went as far as to make an attack response to make them seem like they weren__ in the wrong. I ended up deleting the post out of fear that my plan had gone so wrong and that they had found it.  &amp;#x200B;  Speaking of leaving their server, I had wanted to do it for a while, but they had told me we needed a break from each other and said I should leave. But I think the break thing was an excuse to get me to leave, because it felt like they kept pushing me to go and got impatient when I took my time. (Personally, I think we need more of an infinite hiatus from each other. As of now, I__ absolutely scared of them, but I don__ know exactly why, and it__ bothering me.)  &amp;#x200B;  This post turned out longer than I had anticipated, but I__e put everything I can remember in it. If anyone can help me clear up what exactly this is, I__ be forever grateful. I just hate keeping this all up inside me without knowing what exactly happened or went on. Thank you."
emotional,"I feel hurt and need someone to turn to, what do I do","TL;DR boyfriend said our relationship is garbage and I__ really hurt, we__e been together for 2 years and I don__ know what to turn to since I can__ go to him.. he__ the one who hurt me_  Why do words hurt me so much?  I__ 20f. He (25m) walked away saying __very fxxxing  day with this garbage_ and I said with what garbage? He said this BS. I said __hat__ garbage_ ? Because I really did want to know what he meant by that, because it__ a pretty strong term to describe anything even during a fight..  he said __his relationship._  We__e been together two years and have two pets and live on our own. I want to cry and break down I__ hurting so bad, he may have been mad but why does he say such hurtful things? I feel useless and worthless and unlovable."
physical,Boyfriend of nearly 6 years pushed me into getting 2 abortions against my wishes,"Tl;dr my boyfriend 15 years older than i forced me into getting two abortions under the pretence ""we weren't ready"". I am finally good enough to the standards he set and he still strings me along My family never knew i was pregnant.   August 2018 I told him i was pregnant. He came to the appointment and had two shots of whiskey after. Handled it well at first. Second Prenatal appointment was awkward, refused prenatal vitamins, no smiles from either of us. He always wrestled me roughly because i was getting rid of it anyway it didnt matter. Asked me why i watched what i ate because it didnt matter. Yelled at me in the regular, avoided me.   I tried to eat a lot of parsley. It didnt work. Aspirin, didnt work. ""You cant clean a house, we arent ready for a baby what would it eat, fucking roaches?"" I cleaned the house hoping maybe i would be ready. Still, no. ""We dont have enough furniture. We need our own place, you're bad at cleaning, we need more time together alone, we need to travel""  Two years later i am still with him and we have bought a house, have furniture, I have a career, we have a car, i clean more now. Seeing a roach gives me that same flashback about why i wasn't good enough to keep my baby.  October 2018   i had a surgical abortion at 13 weeks, we had to drive 4 hours and stay over night to make the appointment. I was terrified as i had just gotten my car back after a car accident. I begged him that maybe we could make things work- he said they wouldn't. I covered all the mirrors in the house because i couldn't stand to look at myself, started drinking, defeated alcoholism later on and he hasnt changed a bit.  February 2019 My second abortion at 6 weeks was at home with pills by his coaxing. Nothing had changed.  I told him never again."
emotional,End marriage?,"TL;DR: I am trying to decide if I should end things with my husband, given his cheating and dishonest past, and I would like to know if my demands: **He needs to delete all ""friends"" he made from dating apps, and people he flirted with, and people he had a sexual relationship with, even if they do stay true friends now. Given he has never been honest with me, I demanded him to open up his phone to me fully so there is transparency and to make sure he is not having unprofessional interactions with other people** are reasonable to rebuild the relationship.  Hi Everyone, my husband and I are in a phase where we are deciding what to do with each other in life and would really appreciate some advice on this.  Some backgrounds on this:  We are an international couple, with very different views on dating. I come from a more traditional background and at my place, if we start a new relationship we are supposed to cut all contact with our EXes, or those who flirted or hooked up. My husband is American, and he makes friends on dating apps like tinder, where they would flirt and stay friends if they don't work out, he would also stay friends with the people he hooked up with. The thing that lead everyone downhill is the time I discovered him making a very sexual post on Reddit and made a Snapchat to sext, and ask to join a zoom room to do some nude video chatting. I proposed to divorce but he put his knee on the ground to beg me to stay.  I am the one with BPD and I cannot accept what he was doing even if he explains that he's professional with the people in the past, and he doesn't think he was cheating since the definition of cheating is to physically meet up for him. Since then my BPD got worse since I lost trust in him and become hyper-sensitive on who he is talking to. I stalked him and make shady comments when he talks to ""friends"" he made over dating apps, we fought bad, really bad, I grab knifes to threaten to take my life (end up having the police called on me multiple times, and restrainted in ER twice), and harmed him during the breakdown too. I know this is not correct and now in therapy i truely realize it is not ok to engage in unsafe situations whatever the reason is. I also realize I did a lot of harm to him physically and emotionally, and I do regret that.  In the end, he cheated multiple times, and would never tell the truth to me until I stalk him and find everything out myself. He said he felt so empty inside and lose himself gradually and he wanted an escape so bad that he cheated on me. He said he is no longer guilty of cheating, because of the harm I have done to him. Even before, when things were not escalated to this level, whenever we have a fight, he would turn to one of his ""friends"" and flirt with them, sext them. He even said, ""I find you cute, and if I were single I would be with you."" He said there is nothing wrong saying that, its just a compliment.  After therapy, I learned to stay calm and don't let BPD act instead of myself. I proposed to end things peacefully and I go back to my home country (which would mean we would probably never see each other again). My husband has issues with separating and wants to rebuild with me. But he is still dishonest with me when I ask him if he is interacting with other people sexually, he says he is not d**oing anything, but he would not reject filtering comments from ""friends"" and would sext them (all of this i have to find out by demanding him to show all his social media to me). He explains that he said he didn't do anything because he is not meeting up with these people (again, it's the idea that it's not cheating if is not physical). In fact, he still talks to the people he cheated on me with, even after multiple attempts of me demanding him to remove those people (which shows he only cares about himself).**  **I proposed 2 minimum conditions that I need for me to work with him towards a life together again:**  1. **He needs to delete all ""friends"" he made from dating apps, and people he flirted with, and people he had a sexual relationship with, even if they do stay true friends now.** 2. **Given he has never been honest with me, I demanded him to open up his phone to me fully so there is transparency and to make sure he is not having unprofessional interactions with other people**  **He said he would work with me but what I am doing is isolating him from his ""friends"" and invading his privacy, and refused to agree to these terms.**  **From where I am from, there are even linked accounts for couples, where we can access each other's social media, and if you are in a relationship, and you refuse to let the other person check the phone, then you must be hiding something, and you can absolutely have no contact with EXes and previous hookups (should block them).**  **At this point, there is no trust and honesty in this marriage, and I do want to end things, but he keeps holding on to me (but still talking with the ""friends"" and not rejecting flirty compliments).**  **I just need some input on this. I know this is very long, and I really appreciate if you read all this and leave some advice.**"
emotional,Tired of being belittled,"TLDR: I am not allowed to have opinions or be depressed; I will get threats because I ""don't appreciate"" that he provides for me financially.  Everyday I (23,F) am told how I don't understand things, I'm stupid or ignorant, while at the same time my father goes on about how great he is (his favourite thing to say: ""I am so smart you know, I know everything."" Like really, he says that).   He sometimes acts like it's just a joke and I should not take it so seriously. But the problem is, it's clearly not a joke; when he gets angry it turns into physical abuse threats and even death threats because of how ""stupid"" and ""lazy"" I am.  No matter what I do, I am never good enough. Didn't hand him a cup of coffee? Wo is him, no one cares for him. Didn't pass my module because I am suffering from severe depression? Just a lazy POS that only cares about herself and is not thinking about the financial implications. Lost a friend to COVID, who ~~is~~ was like a brother to me and is in a ""bad mood"" because of it? Should lighten up and not be so moody.  I am never able to express any independent opinion, unless it agrees with his. Because if I disagree I'm just stupid and don't understand how the world works.  Today I was also told in a by the way manner, like it's supposed to be a joke, ""You should care about other people""... because I didn't laugh at one of his ""jokes"". Excuse me?   I give up. He makes me so mad, but if I show I am mad, I get threats. I get told I will be disowned because, I don't know, I don't appreciates that he provides for me financially???   Shit, sorry, didn't realise despite you physically and emotionally abusing my mother and emotionally abusing me for 20+ years, I am not allowed to suffer from depression simply because you paid my university tuition and rent.  I am sorry I can't be grateful towards a father who was absent emotionally and complains every time he has to pay for my needs.  I am an only child... which my parents had when they were in their late 30s. No one told you to get married or have a child! If you hate your life with your wife and your one child so much, then you should have gotten a divorce a long time ago to live your man-child dream where you can go drinking with your friends and ride a motorcycle into the sunset. It is not my fault that you married, it is not my fault that I was born. If you hate your life choices, don't blame it on me. I didn't even ask to exist...   \*Sorry for the sarcasm and anger, I am so hurt and so hopeless. I wish I could talk to him, but I can't without being threatened and belittled\*"
emotional,Gifts as repentance,"TLDR: my parents have been emotionally abusive my whole life and continuously try to gaslight me and convince me im a terrible person, followed by gifts and affection. I consciously know this is manipulative but keep subconsciously falling for it and i dont know how to stop.  My parents have been emotionally abusive my entire life as well as neglectful, and just generally terrible people. Throughout several decades my many older siblings as well as myself have been nonstop victims to their negligence, gaslighting, unpredictability and narcissism. Abandoning their kids in times of need, being physically abusive to some of us, and in my case they raised me in such a way that i was never in the same place longer than a week due to their desire to travel and was in constant physical and emotional danger due to severe illness, attempted kidnappings, and complete instability.  I have spent years being entirely isolated from everyone other than my parents and my two youngest brothers (all the older siblings had cut them out and we were forbidden from talking to them because they were ""sociopaths, psychopaths, alcoholics, drug addicts, thieves and liars"" which is, of course entirely fabricated). I was hit, or under frequent threat of physical harm. I was taken off of medications important to my mental health as a form of punishments for things as trivial as not sharing my food. All sorts of crazy other shit- if i wished to keep triggering information about my mental health private from my 12 year old brother i was a sociopath, if i talked to someone they fired due to my dads mania i was a ""viscious, vile and violent person"", if i claimed to be afraid of my father i was ""a threat to my mothers physical safety and incredibly violent"" (for reference i am 5'2, haven't worked out in years and have never even come close to a physical fight in my life)  This all finally came to a head when they tried to cut me off entirely from the world. They found out i was talking to two of my siblings and were going to take all my access to other people away. No school, phone, computer, hell even the wifi was completely shut down. I panicked and tried to move away in the few hours i had left before they got home and put the new rules in place, but my sister was threatened with a kidnapping charge so i called it off. Their current moving out rules are that i am completely allowed to leave but if i do they will choose the place i live, but will not be paying for it or supporting me in any way (the area i live in is EXTREMELY expensive), will not allow me to get a job, will not allow me to have a phone or wifi, will file for a restraining order on any of my siblings who try to talk to me, and a kidnapping charge to anyone who houses me for any amount of time. They also keep reiterating that they might just kick me out and enforce these rules anyways.   In the 2-3 days since this went down theyre making an effort.. I think?? Ive seen the cycle before where they fight with you and then use money to make up for it afterwards. I just dont really know what to do with it anymore though because they'll seem like they're making efforts to finally remember things about me- favourite foods, bands or hobbies- and will make efforts to give me things to aid in those interests. They'll shower me with praise and attention. Even if i hate it, i cant say i hate them. It sucks to admit it but everytime they act like this i realize how badly i want them to love me. They act so sweet the whole time, and every few things they do they'll have a ""serious"" talk with me where they say how i've been lying to everyone in my life, that nothing i criticized them for ever really happened, and that they cant believe what a terrible person ive become after all the effort they put into raising me. Immediately after that, a new sketchbook and some of my favourite food to soothe the wound. Consciously, i know what they're doing. But no matter how aware i am or how much i fight it, it always works on me. I always get confused and begin to convince myself i was crazy, convince myself that everythings fine and that im the bad person. Convince myself that they really know me.  I guess the end thing im looking for in this vent is how other people have handled this? How do you keep yourself from falling back into that pit of confusion and instead continue to stick strong to reality? It hurts to have to continuously pull myself back to the real world and realize over and over again how awful everything actually is. Its like some weird drug."
emotional,My groomer found my TikTok and is trying to contact me again,"To make a long story short, I am 17, from the US, and Autistic and became friends with this woman from the Netherlands who is 26 and Autistic over a singing app called Smule. We texted and called every day and eventually started a relationship. I was in love with her and she kept promising she__ never do anything to hurt me despite our age gap making her dance a little too close to the line of pedophilia. She constantly asked if something was wrong if I couldn__ call her because we called every day to the point where we were codependent on each other. Whenever I told her I was uncomfortable with the direction our relationship was heading she just brushed me off and said everything would be ok. I finally saw the light last October and told her I was ending things because of our problematic age gap and the fact that she wasn__ respecting my boundaries. She basically tried to gaslight me into saying she didn__ mean anything by it and if it did happen it was her Autism talking. I blocked her on all platforms I followed her on, except one, TikTok. Yesterday she messaged me on TikTok, it was a totally innocent message, sharing a video of a fellow autistic creator and asking to help make the app more inclusive. I didn__ know what to say to her because as much as I wanted to be petty and ask why I would help her after she groomed me, I knew it would only make things worse. So I just sent a response saying that I __idn__ know we were talking again_ and resolved to ignore anything else she might send since she doesn__ use TikTok often and probably would respond back. However not only did she respond to the message, she followed me again and commented on a bunch of my videos. Something that comes with my Autism is the feeling of obligation to respond to everyone__ comments, or to at least like them to acknowledge that I read them. I__ trying so hard to fight that urge and not engage with her because I don__ want her to start guilt tripping me again. I know I__ rambling a lot, but I truly didn__ expect to wake up to a bunch of notifications from my groomer and I made me feel really uncomfortable. I know it wasn__ the smartest idea to respond to her in the first place, I know I should just open TikTok and block her right now, but I needed to vent somewhere.  EDIT: She has been blocked."
physical,I think I might have TBI,"To preface this, I__ 18 years old and I__e been struggling with a multitude of issues for the past couple of years. I have an indescribably bad anger problem, my emotions can sometimes be sporadic, I struggle with building friendships, and concentrating for a decently extended period of time. While I__ far from what I could be, I__e somewhat started to try and alleviate these symptoms by going for walks, sleeping at reasonable times, or practicing breathing exercises. While they do help, I still feel fundamentally broken as a person.   Now, it dawned on me about a week ago that maybe my problems weren__ caused by some bad stroke of luck through my genes or psychological predisposition, but by my parents, specifically my dad. Now, I hate to say it, but my parents are the equivalent of trailer trash. As you know, a kid will be a kid, and that means that they__l be hyperactive and filled with a lot of energy. Well, I was very a hyperactive child to put it frankly and I would absolutely annoy the ever living shit out of my parents judging by the way they reacted. My dad would sit me down next to him on the couch gripping me tightly, and when I wanted to move around or get up from my seat, he__ take a metal a spoon and beat that over my head repeatedly until I would stop crying. I was around 3-4 when this happened. I__e had to endear being beaten with a leather belt over the head, but nothing seems worse they whacking a toddlers skull with a metal rod essentially. My mom would scream at my dad to stop, but she eventually gave up and left me to be abused while she hid in the other room. Not once did she call the cops, file for a divorce, or even talk some sense to my dad. They__e still together, are still terrible people, but much older and slower. I__ getting ahead of myself.   Aside from the emotional trauma, I__ terrified of the idea that my dad might have inflicted lasting damage to my brain. Like I said earlier, I display some very troubling symptoms. I__ not sure if this is scientifically validated or not, but I remember reading somewhere that about 8 out of 10 domestic abuse survivors suffer from some varying degree of TBI. I__ like to seek out help, but my mom thinks, and yes she said this to my face, that I__ being a pussy."
emotional,Trying to figure out my situation ( long ),"To start off, i__ a teen who is in joint custody between my mom/stepdad and dad/stepmom. i__e always been glued to my moms hip and helped with and given a lot. and my dad wasn__ much in the picture growing up. but now that i__ older, my dad is trying to include me in the family and help me whenever i need it. my mom on the other hand ( for the past three years ) has been using her wills against me. saying things like _ i give you everything and you give back nothing. our entire household revolves around you, you__e all we argue about and you__e selfish and ungrateful _ this started because i was missing my first homecoming with a date to go with, because of a birthday trip for me. i told her i was only upset and crying because i was looking forward to it, not because i wanted to cancel the trip they had planned for me, i was upset because i had to tell my boyfriend who had also never been with a date, that i could no longer come. i was very sad so i started to cry, which then led to my mom quite literally screaming at me to just say i wanted to cancel the trip for something as stupid as a school dance. that wasn__ my intention at all, i never wanted her to feel like i was ungrateful for the trip and i did my best to explain, but by that point it was already too late and it went to her crying about how she failed as a mother and how she thought my depression ( diagnosed ) was because she spoiled me and gave me everything growing up. i never want her to buy me anything again just so we can__ argue about this anymore... i feel bad for being disappointed over something important to me. idk if this counts as emotional abuse but my therapist said it did and she__ out of town so i can__ talk to her about this. my dad will want me to move in with him but his house is a very stressful environment for me and i end up feeling overworked there too. please help me"
emotional,I can__ deal with my father anymore,"Today I had waken up to my father throwing out something I had purchased that wasn__ expensive but also not cheap. I had confronted him this morning and he looked at me and said __es, I threw it out_ without any hesitation or understanding how wrong it was to do that. He said it as if it was totally okay to throw it out.  I shouldn__ of have but I did explode on him with anger and I had swore at him because of how much anger I have built up over the years of him picking on me, basically bullying me for the use of cannabis or anything I say or do when he__ a alcoholic himself and has nothing to look forward to other than complain everyday.  During covid, he__ just been so toxic that I can__ even have a conversation with him. Two days ago, we had a great conversation, we laughed, made jokes and all that and we were all good and then out of thin air he decided to throw out something that I worked for. How pathetic.  Is my dad a narcissist? My mom is just as worse."
physical,Anyone ever reported a parent for physical abuse? How did it go and should I do it,"Today I was randomly thinking about an isolated event that happened a year ago, my nDad and I were working outside and he got really angry because I didn__ want to help him with something and he threw a drill at me while I was walking away. It gave me a small injury on the calf and it used to hurt while walking for a week or two. I didn__ report it to police then because I was still living with my parents so I would have had to move out if I reported him and it would affect my family. I knew I wasn__ in any danger and it was very unlikely something like that would happen again, I also didn__ knew I would have a scar from it. Now, a year later, I still have a small (0.8cm~) scar on my calf that is still noticeable and it makes me sad since it probably won__ go away quickly. I find it unfair he got away with it and I still have that small scar. I didn__ report him then to avoid causing turmoil in the family and having family members cut me off because of it. I__ planning on moving out soon so is it still possible to report him a year later? Should I have reported him then and what would have happened to him? Anyone actually reported a parent, what happened? I__ like to hear some opinions and know what can I do about it now."
physical,I__ done. I__ tired,Tonight after Melbourne cup my husband was Angry cause I don__ take my atm card.  He threw His phone which landed at The car park.  Unsure what will Happen. Anyway he hugged me and went to bite me on my Cheek.  I__ Done. I__ tired   Twenty years of being controlled. I love him So much but honestly we have all been Here.  He never wanted Me To work.  No skills I__ 50. Ladies never give up Where you work.  I urge you
physical,Sound Torture and a secret countdown.,"Tonight's abuse is brought to me by dubstep. He's had the speaker on the stairs, full blast, playing the same 4 second sound on a loop. Just to fuck with me.   I never thought I could hate dubstep this much. Actually no, dubstep isn't that great, it's not a leap to go from mild dislike to hatred.   I have a little countdown that he doesn't know about which is making it all bearable. I've got a van booked. I've got two chaps arriving very soon and they're going to carry all my little belongings into their van, and then they're going to drive them away to my new home. And he won't know what's happening until I open that front door to them.   So he can play his dubstep, he can goad me by blowing smoke at me. And I'll play the injured doe, crying and broken. But I know I'm going. And in a few days I'll be falling asleep in a bed he will never find."
physical,Finding the Courage,"Tried to post on JustNoSo, need some help and advice, please.  My husband has always been a bit scary. Escalating events of rage, driving temper tantrums, punches walls, breaking things, screams in my face, yells at curses at every inconvenience. Once he said he wished I was dead. When he's really mad, he will hit himself and grunt like an animal.  His anger has a hair trigger. There's no telling what will set him off. He doesn't like my family and won't let me talk to or see my friends. Saying he is just being protective.  I work full time and also take care of everything in the house. I do all laundry, cleaning, cooking, serving him meals, dishes and take out trash. If I don't, he yells at me for being lazy.  It's exhausting to live with.  He's never hit me but has shoved me and thrown things at me. Once punched a wall near my head.  I have horrible self esteem and anxiety issues and I've gotten used to his terrorizing. I just try to make myself seem small and invisible.  I've told him I'm afraid but he says that I'm just over-dramatic. He says it's just normal expression of anger and it's fine. He says the problem is my fear.  I know I need to get him out of my house and life and get my safety back. But it seems so hard to accomplish! So I am looking for success stories - how did you overcome and escape? How do you untangle yourself from this? How do you forgive yourself?"
physical,"After a really rough eight months supporting my best friend through a DV, she finally went to the police.","Trigger warning (punching and choking) Advice needed. Honestly wish I found this sub sooner, but without getting too far into it, let m recap by saying that in the last two weeks my best friend took her abuser back. All hell broke loose over the weekend and he strangled her for so long that she thought that was it for her. He also gave her a concussion. She was so freaked out that she somehow got him out of her apartment, called her mum and went and reported EVERYTHING. They gave the police over 100 photos of her after every time he bruised or made her bleed.  He was arrested a few hours later, charged with two counts of assault causing grievous bodily harm. He went to court today and is out on bail for two weeks then has his plea day.   My girlfriend is obviously feeling a very long list of emotions from numb, guilty, regrets turning him in, to seething with hate for him etc.  The DV team have organised counselling for her next week which is a great start.  I was wondering if you guys have any advice as to how I can help support her through the next part of this?  I__ pretty good at not trash talking this guy too much, I know my boundaries but mostly I feel like what__ helping her at the moment is just letting her talk. Any advice welcomed."
emotional,Am I overreacting?,"Trigger warning ? Over the years I__e noticed that my lifestyle isn__ like others. My parents are divorced and I rarely get to see my dad. Since life at home is difficult he__ my safe place. When I say life at home is difficult I don__ know how to explain it. It__ not that I__ traumatised from big events, it__ more like little things adding up everyday and I__ starting to think that I can__ take it anymore. My mum makes me feel worthless like I__ never enough. She always yells at me for staying in my room like any Asian parent but she doesn__ let me close my door. I don__ wanna tell her but I only stay in my room because I__ scared to be around her. I__ extremely anxious and it seems like she always finds something to yell at me for. There was also a time where I got moved down a class for tutor and I started crying when my teacher told me because I knew how my mum would react. The teacher discussed it with her and she started talking about how it__ because I__ always on my phone and that I__ not trying hard enough. It may not seem like a lot but I don__ know. It__ gotten to the point where I__e considered taking my life but I__e stopped self harming so that__ good I guess. I also have a little step brother and I have to take care of him but when he doesn__ do something my mum told him to do my mum blames it on me telling me that I__ old enough to know. I don__ understand how I__ supposed to take care of him when I can break take care of myself.   I feel like she socially isolates me. Not that she doesn__ let me have friends but she rarely lets me go out with friends. I__ stuck at home with a full schedule. Every week I break down because it__ just too much. I have to practise an instrument everyday and if I forget to practice one day I have to practice double the next. I also have language school which I asked her if I could quit, she said no of course. I also have first aid cadets, and tutor, as well as swimming and another sport. I don__ mind the sport it keeps my mind off everything but yeah. I don__ think I__e reached my absolute breaking point yet but recently I__e started to just cry everytime she tells me to do something. I__e talked to my friend about it. He said it__ probably because I__ tired but i don__ know. I feel so weird sharing this because I feel like I__ bothering everyone with my problems but thank you for sticking with me  When I was about 11 or twelve I don__ quite remember because it wasn__ something I wanted to remember, a family member touched me inappropriately and at first I didn__ think much if it. I thought that if I pretended that it didn__ happen then I would be fine. But the few days after that I had this overwhelming feeling and it was like I had to tell someone. So I eventually told my uncle whom I trust more than my mother. I broke down explaining to him :/ he told my mum and she brought it up to me a few days later and she completely ignored how I felt. She put the total blame on me. She said that I should__e said __o_. You don__ realise how hard it is to say no until you__e in that situation. After that I was scared of men for a few years, I genuinely thought it was my fault and I still have to visit that family member frequently but my mum acts like nothing happened. I have panic attacks every time I walk past him but it__ getting better. sorry guys this kind of turned into a rant :/  I__e also gotten into a relationship last year but my mum found out and she made me break up with him. But honestly I__ only keeping my sanity because I have him. He calms me down and reassures me. I have to secretly see him :(  There was this one time I broke down infront of him and he knows what I__ going through so he said ____ proud of you okay_ that made me cry so much because I don__ remember the last time someone has said that to me. Because I didn__ grow up in an affectionate family, he had to teach me how to hug, and say the words __ love you_ I was really uncomfortable with these things before but now I__ used to it tanks to him  this is getting a bit lengthy I__ sorry okay yeah it did turn into a rant my apologies :/"
physical,Abuser trying to hurt our pet because I left. What do I do??,"Trigger warning for explicit physical and sexual violence   After months of nonstop brutal abuse that has traumatized me, given me permanent injuries and nearly killed me... I left. I moved out about two months ago. We__e still been in contact, I know I should__e cut them off but I didn__. We had two cats together who I absolutely adored (and that my abuser could not care less about) and I wasn__ able to take them with me, so of course he has been using them to toy with my mind and try to talk me into coming back. Recently he hasn__ been taking care of them at all and asked me to take them, but of course never wanted to have a real discussion about it because he knows how badly I want them and so as long as he has them he thinks I__l stay in touch (which sadly has worked up until this point). Recently while I was seeing him at our old house he sexually assaulted me (and took videos of it, which he__ done before). A few days later I tried to confront him about it because he__ promised he__ going to change and said he needs me to tell him when something hurts me so that he can know and do something about it. It__ been working before this incident but this time he just denied everything, said he did nothing wrong blah blah blah. And very aggressively told me I had to stay the night and promised he wouldn__ hurt me, promised we wouldn__ have sex at all. The next morning he very forcefully assaulted me, when I was yelling no he choked me until I couldn__ say it anymore. It completely broke me and when he eventually let me leave I stopped responding to texts and calls and haven__ gone back. He__ been harassing me with threats ever since, saying he__l report me to the police for stealing a phone (that he gave me to borrow after breaking mine, that I__e said I will mail back to him), that he__l come find me at my workplace, that he__l figure out where I live. It__ terrifying. But he__ also trying to hurt my beloved cat. I__e seen him physically abuse her before, I__e seen her limping because of him. It breaks my heart but i was never able to say anything without him directing all of that towards me. He said that if I don__ show up when I was __upposed to come over_ that he__l let her outside in the freezing cold and let her either starve or freeze to death. He sent me a video of her cowering in the corner of the house absolutely terrified, but because it doesn__ explicitly show any violence I can__ get anyone to do anything about it. I__ at such a loss for words. I know I can__ really do anything to stop him and it__ completely out of my control but I really don__ want anything to happen to her. She is one of the only reasons I was able to cope. Is there anything at all that I can do? I__ being as safe as I can be and I wish I could just go over there and take her but if he found out I did that he__ kill me. I__ so lost."
emotional,Not sure how to process this one,"TRIGGER WARNING SEXUAL ABUSE  I__ not sure what happened. I recently just got married. In a happy healthy relationship. This post is about past emotional abuse and possible triggers. I__ still learning what triggers me.  What happened was, on my wedding party day my now MIL triggered me so badly that I__ not sure how to process it.  She said some menial things, toxic/mean/rude things to my family and to me about my cooking. Not to mention she didn__ even come to the wedding. She just came to the party and only showed up for 45 minutes then left. I was so heartbroken for my now husband.  But she enraged something in me that made me no longer want her in my life. I wanted to cut off all contact of her. I was almost willing to not be with my husband anymore if that__ what it took to not have her in my life anymore. I posted about this issue in the MIL Reddit page and got a lot of good feedback. But I didn__ mention my past emotional abuse history there. But I think she is a highly toxic and narcissistic, __t__ my way or the highway_ kind of person.   But my ex fianc_© was my emotional abuser. I was in the relationship for 8 years. It took him to not to want me anymore, to cheat on me, and to rape me for me to see what what was happening. I felt so stupid. But like my therapist said, I did what I thought would keep me safe.  How do I handle this? I__l take any advice __  (Im sorry I know this post is sporadic and may not make much sense but I tried my best)"
physical,What if I see him again?,"TRIGGER WARNINGS: DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, SEXUAL VIOLENCE, ASSAULT, PROTECTION ORDER   I am safe. I am safe. I am safe.   I live in Seattle. I was granted a domestic violence protection order in January ! Our city and state are trying to open things up now and I'm excited and vaccinated ! but still plan to isolate for a while more. I'm hopeful. And I'm terrified because what do I do if I see him again? Can I tell him to get 500 feet back from me or am I breaking my own order then? Do I automatically have staying power anywhere I am and he has to leave? What if we both bought tickets to a venue? What if he stalks my favorite artists and finds me that way? What if I have my dog (who is larger than me and still has puppy forgetfuls even w great training)and gets excited to see him?  What if I can't play rugby? I guess I'd also like to take this time to tell me some of my story.    I chose to go to university near my parents in MO bc I was learning to love w bipolar and cptsd and need a lot of support. I met VLB, one of my residents became a coworker then a fling then a relationship then we lived together a year. Had a lot of toxic patterns established but broke up bcuz VLB moved to Chicago after grad 2015. Stayed in touch. I change my name and announce I'm poly amorous and pansexual in 2017. 2019 I start making plans to move to Seattle bc MO is not a good environment for me. A mutual friend, RL lives in Seattle so we start looking for places. VLB says he's miserable and Chicago and wants to join us. He knows that we are only friends. My bff joins in on my plans even tho I tell her it's a bad idea. She says our love is strong enough and I believe her. In retrospect I see all of my weak and non exist boundaries and I was in a low key episode leading up to moving in June 2019. All four of us are in a 3 bedroom in south Seattle. Bff and I are sharing a LARGE room w a bathroom. By sept, her and I are on the outs and can't communicate effectively. I get really sick from stress and become basically bulimic for a couple months. In October I tried to physically remove her from the house after she started screaming at me. Technically assault and very short sighting, but I wasn't intent on hurting her I just wanted to lock her out. It's still harmful and toxic behavior. VLB split us up and offer to switch rooms with BFF so she could stay and I said no but they said yes. I couldn't leave at this point bc I was barely making enough money and didn't know anyone else in the city, I was signed into a lease and the reason they were all under the same house together. Oh and my car went kaput so he let me use his car. VLB would treat me to dinner or a night out but then hold it over me. He would wait until we were both drunk then try to make sexual advances at me. In vulnerable times, I would cave even though I knew it'd be messy. And then he started professing his love for me and kept saying we were open partners. In November 2019, idk anything else besides we were all drinking and then I woke up convulsing to VBL pulling RL off me. In Jan 2020 we'd ""broken up"" so many times. I was usually always a closing bartender he'd wait up drunk for me to get home only to scream at me for whatever. He get pillows until he moved on to walls. If I was late he'd track me through my laptop. BFF and RL said I needed medication and help. I said VLB needed help. He said he'd go to therapy but would never follow through even w all of his resources. Bff moved out at the end of Jan 2020 and I got my own room. I could always hear VLB and RL talk shit about me. RL would scoff or groin anytime I was in the same room as him then call my dog to him. He'd purposely scare my dog but making loud sounds, etc. He drew red eyes and devil horns on my pictures. VLB would still stalk me and sometimes show up to my bar w my dog. One time, after screaming at each other late and night and finally getting him out of my room he lunged at my as I was shutting the door and I hit him to get him out of my door way and closed the door. Then the next morning RL woke me up to tell me that I had toxic behavior and needed help. By the time covid shortened my hours I knew I needed to leave on way or another. I found a craiglist may 2020 women's house in north Seattle and some coworkers helped me move. VBL agreed to cut all connect to allow healing but would still text or message or Instagram me and then the coworker that helped me move. I would ignore or tell him to stop. I changed my number in Sept 2020 and warned VBL to stop or I would escalate.  I started my domestic violence protection order request in Nov 2020 but he got a lawyer and they kept trying to get more time for me to drop it. Thankfully it was granted against VBL. I never sought one against RL bc he only harassed me in the house to side w VBL. Now I'm in a studio in Seattle ! And I'm finally gaining weight ! All my accounts are on private. I don't go out besides work and walks but that's going to change at some point. And the thing I'm most excited for is rugby. I miss playing and being on a team and I'd love my dog to be a mascot of something in this life bc he's so cute. But RL has been playing rugby for a Seattle team since before I moved. What if I run into him? What if they're both there? Only VBL is required to go. I guess I could check derby out but it's not outdoors.      Anyone wanna scenario play or direct me to better resources?   Thank you kindly and stay safe"

physical,Baby trapped,"TW Traumatic Childbirth, Sexual Assault, Reproductive Coercion, Physical Abuse  When you__e in an abusive relationship, you__e not allowed to be upset or react to conflict.

I__ finding that now that I__ not entirely out of the woods, but at least not under constant control, those feelings are bubbling back up to the surface. There is so much in our 4 year marriage to unpack, but the soup of the week is that time my dear husband threw away my birth control.  We had discussed having another child and I wanted to wait, for a multitude of reasons. I almost died giving birth to our first child.

To this day I don__ honestly know what he would have done. He hadn__ been physically abusive at this point. Why was I afraid to react? Am I just that conflict avoidant? Or was I beginning to sense the danger in the water. The thought crossed my mind to get an IUD or another method of bc. I could have done so without his knowledge even, but how could I lie to my husband? What kind of wife would do that? So I did nothing. I felt almost nothing.  Today? Today I__ raging. I__ so angry I__ a nervous wreck about it. Now I feel it. How could a husband do such a thing? Some might call it reproductive coercion. Even rape. But can you call it that when I did nothing? A year after he threw away the bc, when I was pregnant and suffering from morning sickness, my husband propositioned me for sex and for the first time in our entire marriage (another story) I told him __o, I__ not feeling well_. I then physical turned away from him and he penetrated me anyway. I did nothing. I just laid there. Rape. My husband raped me. Not reacting didn__ make it less so. I told him __o_. He did it anyway.

He tried to ignore her and turn but she said __on__ ignore me_ and hugged him anyway. I started to ignore him and he ended up getting mad at me and leaving. When I got back that night I obviously was still upset, drunk, and was questioning him about it and I must__e said something again he didn__ like and he tried to push me into the ground in my bedroom. I shutup and ignored him and later in my bed because I didn__ want things to escalate and he started yelling at me in my face. I got scared and started crying and he full force punched me in my stomach. I curled up in a ball and hid my face because I didn__ know what else to do. he proceeded to yell at me. once he moved I ran to the bathroom and hid until he was calm and snuck out and slept in my roomates room. The next morning he was so apologetic but said he agreed we needed to breakup bc things were too bad. somehow I feel like I__ being punished.  I always loved and was understanding. He__ been abused as a child and has so many issues and I wasn__ so oblivious that I thought I could love him enough to heal him but he__ someone who wants to change but never truly makes enough of an effort to. He consistently talked to other girls throughout the relationship but never __ctually_ cheated on me. I__ confused on love and the only thing keeping me was feeling that I would never find anyone else, being with him was better than being alone.   My family knew about the second time and tried to help me. I got away and stayed with my sister for three weeks and fell for his trap when he came crawling back promising me everything. I really believed him. idk how to tell my support system I was stupid again. I just feel stupid and alone. I__e pushed everyone away during this relationship idk what to do now."
emotional,My Abuser is dying and I am having a lot of feelings,"TW: Cancer, death, and dying . . . . . . . Hi friends,  So, growing up, my father has always been super emotionally and verbally abusive, as well as being toxic in a multitude of other ways.  I finally had the courage to complete cut him out of my life when I was 15, a few years after my mother divorced him.  Before I had cut him out, he was battling cancer. And now recently, I found out that his cancer is back and doctors said that he's only got a short time left to live.   I feel so weird finding out that he's dying. I haven't had any contact with him for years. But, I feel sad? And I don't wanna be sad? But, I am?  Has anyone else gone through this? I feel like I should be relieved but I'm not?   I'm hella confused about my feelings"

physical,I think I'm ready for a hemorrhoidectomy,"TW: I'm going to talk about anal rape and the lasting effects it's had on my butthole. It will probably be gross for some people.       Part of my abuse was being regularly anally raped. It was aggressive and violent and during that time I developed hemorrhoids. I left him almost 5 years ago now, and I get flare ups from my hemorrhoids 2-4 times a year that are extremely painful and every time I spend that week or so having repeated PTSD flashbacks to the rapes. Awhile back I looked into how to really get rid of them and I read about surgery but everything about it scared me. The recovery scares me, the idea of someone being that close to my butthole is terrifying, it's not a place I normally let people investigate and it's nerve wracking to think about after the rapes. But now I've been putting in a lot of work in therapy and recently have gotten strong enough to start addressing some of my codependent behaviors. So yesterday I started thinking - there's a lot of things from that relationship that I will have to carry for the rest of my life, but the hemorrhoids and their accompanying flashbacks doesn't have to be one of them. I think I might be ready to actually have the surgery. All of the scary things about it are still scary, and I anticipate having a lot of emotions during the entire experience, but I think I might be ready. In some weird way it feels like I'm reclaiming something, or stepping into my own power or something."
emotional,Trying to figure out if my mother is emotionally abusive or if I__ overreacting,"TW: Mentions of unhealthy eating habits, body image issues and mentions of suicide    I don't really go over to other people's houses and see how their family dynamics work but from what I've heard and seen, mine isn't really normal...? This is just so I can get some sort of sense as to how much of my life actually makes sense.  That being said, here's a list of the things that happen in my house that I find unreasonable:  1. A family day on the weekend every week.    1. I say family day but it's really a ""spend time doing what my mom wants"" day. We suggest a movie, a game to play together, baking together, or whatever we can do at home that involves family bonding and she says she wants to go out. In the Canadian cold. During covid. Not to mention it's to malls and heavily crowded areas while she's technically part of a high-risk group.       1. P.S, she doesn't want me or my siblings to go see our friends because she's high risk but all our friends have pretty closed-off circles which makes it safer for us to go see them instead of going on another family day.  2. Cleaning days every week.    1. Sure, sounds normal enough but usually, it's on a school day and we only get an hour to eat after school when we get home AND finish our homework before we have to clean. And the wifi gets shut off. And if we don't finish, we're not allowed to have wifi until we finish. This is kind of an issue because most of our classes have moved homework online but she prioritizes cleaning over homework...? I'm not sure if this is normal or not so please tell me in the comments.    2. Also, if we refuse to clean to prioritize homework instead, she threatens to sell the house and just get a smaller one because it would be more manageable and we would have to switch schools away from our friends for the fourth time.   3. Homework isn't the first priority.    1. I struggle with procrastination and I can only do homework if I'm really feeling motivated to do it. Not the ""Oh I just don't want to do it"" kind of procrastination, the sitting in front of a blank piece of paper for two hours and crying because I can't make myself do it kind of procrastination. For some reason, whenever I *do* feel motivated to do homework is when she needs me to clean or go out with her. I try to explain that I want to do my homework but she says that her thing is more important. This is the same with my siblings minus the motivation issue. Even my sister who's a pretty good student has to deal with this.   4. Consistently making me take care of my brother instead of her doing it herself    1. I understand that it's reasonable for an older sibling to take care of their younger siblings but whenever he gets in trouble, I have to punish him. If he won't do something, I have to make him do it because she's too tired to. It was even my responsibility at some point to pack his lunch and watch him until his bus got there to pick him up. I'm learning at home so this is convenient for my mother. I wouldn't be bothered by this but the issue is that I have to do this when my class starts because our schools start class at different times. She said that she was tired and that she couldn't do it but eventually, I got tired and she started doing it again with no issue.   5. Constant remarks about me and my siblings' bodies and insisting we lose weight    1. So, I've struggled with body issues since she's been telling me that I need to lose weight since I was a child. This isn't just with me, it's with my siblings too. I have made it very clear that I don't like it when she makes these remarks yet she still does it and does other things that are clearly meant for me and my sister. She's the reason I dislike exercising. She only makes it about weight and body image even though I want it to be about being healthy. She *only* makes it about weight and says that my friends will stop talking to me because I look bad. This has, of course, taken it's toll on my mental health, as evident to me currently being diagnosed with a slurry of mental health issues. However, this doesn't stop her behaviour. Even after consistently trying to explain to her, she just doesn't seem to grasp the concept. Yes, I want to exercise. Yes, I want to be healthy. But I want to be healthy because I want to be healthy, not to lose weight. It just really hurts because there's days that I've literally starved myself because of her comments and even then she still makes them. She also tends to brush off these comments as just jokes when we get upset.  6. This is a big red flag that might be a little triggering so a fair warning.    (TW: Mentions of suicide)    1. So, I had an English assignment where I was supposed to write a poem or find a poem about a personal experience. I had been struggling with mental health so I planned to write a poem on suicide. Fast forwards a few days and I had finished my poem and planned to meet up with my friend after submitting it but my friend suggested that I ask the teacher if it's okay that my poem is about suicide before I send the poem. So, I sent the email before I left to go see my friend and off I went.    I don't have a phone plan. I have a data plan that I use VoIP to call people. I usually have my data shut off because of overage charges. I turned on the data to find that I had missed calls from my aunt, my dad, my mom and my aunt's friend. Turns out, they all got a call from the school asking if I was okay because of my poem that I asked my teacher about (I didn't send in the poem, just asked if it was okay).     To sum it up, my mom picked me up and then went to pick up my friend so we could hang out at my house instead of hers. We went and bought snacks and a book which was strange behaviour for my mom because I was never allowed to buy snacks or a book when we went shopping. My friend and I hung out for a few hours before her dad picked her up. I thought my mom would talk to me about it afterwards or something but nope. Nothing.     When we got into an argument the following day, she said ""I was so nice to you yesterday and this is how you repay me?"" which... I'm not sure what to think of. On one hand, she was right - she was strangely nice to me instead of how she usually was. On the other, I knew it was only because of what the school had told her and that made me a little upset that the only reason she would be nice to me was if I had mentioned suicide.   7. My dad admitted that he believed my mother was definitely some kind of abusive but he didn't want to dig into it because he loves her.    1. My dad is a great dad but he's so constantly wrapped up with dealing with her and making sure our dysfunctional family doesn't fall apart. He does all the cooking, he does most of the cleaning, he helps me and my siblings with homework, he wants my brother to get diagnosed and medicated for a learning disability (but my mom won't let him because she read an article that said the medicine was addictive), he doesn't have any friends outside of my mom and her friend groups, he can't do anything unless it's with her or it's work. He said he loves her but it hurts me that he's trapped in this kind of relationship. I want my dad to be happy and he seems so miserable, despite how hard he might try to hide it. I want my dad to have a partner who puts in the same effort into the relationship as he does. He doesn't agree with my mom's parenting but there's nothing he can do about it because if he argues against her, she threatens divorce.   8. She uses the wifi as a means to control everyone.    1. If she doesn't get her way, the wifi gets shut off. This doesn't affect her because she has data but it affects me and my siblings. She has a higher data plan than I do and that means she has a lot more freedom when the wifi gets shut off. If we won't clean, the wifi goes out. If we won't exercise, the wifi goes out. If we don't want to go out with her, wifi goes out. This can last for days on end and it's worse during the breaks because we don't have any school or anything.     Do not think this is me complaining about not be able to play games - this is not a bratty kid hates their parent because they can't use the wifi to finish a level and blah blah blah. This is about her cutting off our entire social circle and she knows that. Because of COVID, the only way to contact my friends is if I have data or if I have access to the internet. She doesn't like that I'm closer with my friends than I am with her which, in my opinion, says something more about her rather than it does about me since she hasn't made an effort to do what I like or try things I want to try.    I also have pretty bad breakdowns at night and cutting off my social circle means that I can't vent when I need to or talk to people who can calm me down. When my mom shuts off the wifi, it closes off my connection to the outside world. It's not about games, it's about my social life.  There's a lot more that I know are there but my brain can't really think of them right now. I've only recently come to the conclusion that she might be emotionally abusive but I really don't want to jump to conclusions and claim something that might not be true.   Please tell me if any of this is normal in your house because frankly, I'd like to see the difference and if any of this is normal behaviour."

physical,The person taken from me,"TW: Self harm/suicide attempts   Hi all, I posted on here about a week ago about my abusive brother and the effects it had on me, some of these include PTSD, depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and alcoholism. Today I thought the same thing I__e questioned every day for years and finally decided to ask if anyone else can relate. Do you ever wonder who you would be if things were different?   If I had a happy childhood would I be able to sleep at night without drinking until I black out? Would I be able to speak openly to my chosen family  who love me? Would I never have developed the fear that someone is always right behind me, breathing over my shoulder and watching me? Would I never have tried to slit my wrists or overdose on pills? Would I be able to get out of bed instead of lying there when the flashbacks overwhelm me?   I__ so angry by this imaginary version of myself I fantasize was stolen from me. I just want to be okay."
emotional,This is so hard.,"TW: Suicide, miscarriage, abortion.   I dated him for over a year. During that time, we endured a miscarriage and an abortion. Well I endured it. He wasn__ present at all for the miscarriage, and wasn__ really there for me during the abortion either. While I was passing our baby during the miscarriage, he thought it appropriate to call me many names, such as cunt, attention whore, bitch, and to accuse me of having it just for attention. I had simply asked him to check up on me as it was a very painful process, and I was scared and going through it alone. I sat on the toilet for hours, crying and terrified, while he was too selfish to ever initiate contact and ask how I was doing. I had asked him if he could just text me during it to make sure I was alright, I have never been in that much pain before, and it was so scary doing that alone. It wasn__ just my baby, it was his too, but he treated me as if I was a stranger. He didn__ want me to text him how it was going while I was at that moment passing our baby over the toilet, because __t hurt him_. He would rather me suffer in silence alone than care to know how I, the woman he got pregnant, was doing in that situation. I later would go on to have a really bad infection that was caused by the miscarrriage, to the point where it required going to the hospital. Rather than support me, or even care, he proceeds to call me awful things the night I got back from the hospital, and ghost me for the week, while I was recovering and unable to move or take care of myself. This was the day where he truly called me vile things, as I was too weak to even move. I couldn__ walk to the kitchen to get myself something to eat. It was that bad. He wouldn__ even take a phone call from my doctor for the sake of my health. While this was going on, I was dealing with postpartum depression, and it hurt my soul to know that the man who got me pregnant did not care enough about me to treat me as a human being during one of the hardest times of my life. He knew how much the miscarriage effected me, he just didn__ care. If it wasn__ about himself, he had absolutely no interest. It was always about him, and his needs were always catered to, not mine. I would do everything for him. I would cook, write him notes, take care of him whenever he needed me, and get him gifts. I was so sweet to a boy too selfish to reciprocate. He didn__ care when I had panic attacks, he would leave me to figure them out by myself. But when the tables were turned, God knows I was there supporting him. I even remember a specific instance where I was having really bad cramps while I was pregnant, and he was too busy playing his video game to comfort me. He waited until he could save in his stupid game rather than immediately see how I was doing. He  had a way of constantly making me feel bad about doing anything. He left me to feel inadequate. I was never enough for him. I was made to not feel pretty enough, I didn__ dress __dgy_ enough, I was never enough. Someone who contributed so little left me feeling like it was all my fault. He always spins everything on someone or something else. I don__ think he__ ever genuinely taken accountability for anything in his life ever.   Why I got back together with him after what he did I will never know. That was a mistake on my part. When we got back together, any effort on his end completely tanked. He made me feel crazy for wanting a note or flowers, just once, even teasing me about it every time we went to a store that sold them. He would point to flowers and such, and say things like __ should probably get you some so you can stop complaining_. (He never did by the way.) He even called me wanting him to write me a note for our anniversary, which I ended up getting him a nice present for, __aterialistic_. He also promised me a dinner, but he never keeps up with his promises, ever. He made me feel awful for ever wanting to talk about my feelings. He didn__ want to hear that his actions hurt me, and would instead silence me. He did this for small things such as showing love, to bigger ones like pregnancy loss.  He unfortunately ended up getting me pregnant again. This time it was healthy. I was a wreck after the miscarriage. Initially when I found out, I immediately wanted it out of me and gone, I was scared. Time went on however, and I had to carry it for a month before the first available appointment. As I was consciously aware I was pregnant, I started to have doubts, and would go back and forth. It was an extremely difficult time in my life. Every time I wanted to have a healthy conversation about it with him, he would resort to threats and would get crazy. He told me multiple times that he would kill himself if I had the baby. It put me in such an awful position, and I was honestly terrified by the person who was supposed to take care of me and protect me through that awful period of my life. This, and the fact that he was not in a good place mentally, he asked me to not talk to him at all about anything negative. I abided. I cared more about him than I did myself while I was pregnant, and looking back, I wish I didn__ give him the time of day. I kept it in when he told me he would kill himself if I didn__ abide by the choice he wanted, I kept it in all the times he exploded on me and attacked me for no reason, I kept it in when he treated me like shit while I was pregnant. He thought it was okay, and that it was funny, while I was pregnant, to fake propose to me at a restaurant. I was devastated, because for a second I thought he was being serious, and maybe had a change of heart to the situation at hand. He couldn__ even hold the door open for me on the way out, his excuse being he didn__ want to hold it open for the people walking behind me. He saw I was upset, and instead of being mature about it, what does he do? He calls his mom and asks for her two cents, not allowing me to tell him my true feelings. I was always just the pit of his jokes. My feelings never mattered to him. He constantly made jokes at my expense all the time. But in his mind, it__ okay, __ecause I don__ deserve respect_. He treated me like this our whole relationship, but the fact he could continue while I was pregnant and in an awful position, is despicable.  I ended up going through the abortion, albeit with hardships. Two days before the procedure I did not want to do, he went crazy. He accused me of faking it, and again, threatened his life, and told me he would hurt himself if I was lying. I left my job early to go to the store and take a pregnancy test to prove it to him. He then does a complete 180 and changes his mood completely and apologizes. The stress he gave me, in a situation where I was already at my max is not acceptable. I got the abortion, and I felt that he felt it over. The period following he didn__ want me to get into my emotions regarding it, and would instead just mask it. I wasn__ allowed to tell him any negativity towards it. We were putting it on pause to deal with when he was better able to take care of me. He got worse, and I put his needs before my own. I took care of him, while I was going through the hardest thing I__e ever gone through, crying every chance I got away from him. I did nice things for him, got him gifts, took care of him, and none of it was returned. He dumped me over the phone after two weeks of treating me like dogshit. He used me. I would do things for him, get him things, he wouldn__ give me, my health, nor my feelings the time of day. He dumped me a month after the abortion he coerced me into having. He didn__ have a gun to my head and made me, but he is outlandish if he thinks that his blatant manipulation and abuse didn__ heavily coerce me into having it. He broke up over the phone, too cowardly to do it in person despite just one month prior I had his child in my womb. Once he saw that I was no longer carrying it, he felt it appropriate to throw me out like a toy he no longer wanted to play with. It__ disgusting, especially after he made all these promises to me to never repeat what happened with the miscarriage. He promised to be there for me, talk through things, and protect me. He did none of that. He is not a man, not a good boyfriend, he__ not even a good person. He always has an excuse for his abuse. We were broken up during the miscarriage, which was his reasoning for not being there for me, and was his justification for calling me all those names while I was in physical pain. During the abortion, his excuse was that even though we were dating, we weren__ married, so he didn__ feel that he had to support me. It wasn__ his responsibility. A month and a half after his sudden and coldhearted dumping, he tried reaching out. I vented my frustrations towards him and wanted to work through it. This has been so impossible to process without the love and support of the partner who should care about my well being. He proceeds to block me again after I vented my feelings about everything he has done to me. He couldn__ handle me telling him the things he did, which honestly had piled up after a few months of not being able to tell him anything about the abuse he put me through.   Him: I__ not doing this Nat if you have this I__l fucking kill myself I swear to God. This is bullshit. I__ not getting stuck in this shit. I__l fucking do it right now. I don__ care.  Me: Don__. I__ sorry I said anything. I__l just keep it to myself from now on. Please don__ do anything irrational.   Him: My baby is (enter music here). And you__e set to abort that too.  Me: Don__ compare our child to something like that. That__ human life. Him: That__ my vaporwave.   Me: I am mourning my child. Him: What child? What gender? What was its name? Me: It had a heartbeat.  Him: It__ name was heartbeat. My dick has a heartbeat. I__l chop it off. Me: It was your child too. How could you not care in the slightest? Him: Because it pisses you off and I live to hurt you.  Him: It__ 50% mine and I elect it to not exist so there you go. Nothing you can do about it now anyways. Me: How can you be so cruel? When you were literally involved. It was 50% yours. Him: Now it__ 100% non-existent. What are you going to do about it? Nothing."
emotional,Stonewalling and The Silent Treatment,"-Usually, stonewalling and the silent treatment go hand in hand. After the victim has been stonewalled, the other person is treated to a form of silence that is deafening. Yet the silent treatment can also occur without warning or stonewalling as well.   In an abusive relationship with a narcissist, the silent treatment and stonewalling are manipulative tactics embedded within the abuse cycle. In the beginning of the cycle, the narcissist may love-bomb their victim and idealize them, giving them excessive amounts of attention to win them over.    In the devaluation phase of the relationship, the tables are turned and the victim is provoked into trying to __in over_ the narcissist. The toxic partner abruptly withdraws from their victim, unwilling to respond for a period of time with little to no explanation whatsoever. This silent treatment causes their partner excessive anxiety, fear and a persistent sense of self-doubt. The narcissist thrives off of the power and control they feel as they continue to pull the strings of the victim like a master puppeteer.   In the context of an abusive relationship, both techniques are deliberately used as control tactics _ ways to intimidate, belittle and demean the victim into feeling insignificant. When a narcissist gives you the silent treatment, it__ a way to devalue you and make you feel invisible. It provokes you into reacting so that you are prone to doing whatever you can to gain back their attention and approval.    Although stonewalling appears to place an end to communication, it actually speaks volumes and communicates something quite cruel to the person on the receiving end. Regardless of the intention of the person doing the stonewalling, this behavior communicates to their partner the following: __ou__e not worth responding to. Your thoughts and feelings don__ matter to me. You don__ matter to me._-  https://thoughtcatalog.com/shahida-arabi/2018/04/stonewalling-and-the-silent-treatment-when-the-narcissists-silence-is-deafening/"

emotional,Was my ex therapist emotionally abusive/abused his power and anyone made similiar experience?,"Was in therapy for 9 months. when I developed feelings for him and told him that even if I know that's not possible I'd have loved to get know him better and he replied ""if we were not in the therapeutic relationship I would have liked to to get to know you too"""", then he asked ""would you dress up for me like in your profil picture and I like your profile picture. "" When I called him out on this he said  ""I only wanted you to dress up nicely for you as it raises people's mood when they dress up nice, and probably tried to make me feel sorry for him as he stated he's overwhelmed with case load and has been sick with covid symptoms  and added ""I will have a talk with my supervisor about this ethical issue and last week in the session he said the supervisor said it's better for me to find someone near me  .When I started to cry so much he seemed to be uncomfortable, dismiss it and just said ""you look good today"" &amp;""feel free to scream at me if you want""  Today he just ended sessions&amp; suddenly probably judged/tried to guilt trip me by saying ""you should stop texting so much, it was 2am when all your  the texts arrived and no other therapist will allow that much contact"".  EVEN THOUGH few months ago he himself encouraged me sharing whatever was on my mind&amp;heart between sessions and dismissed it,when I said ""I think you need stronger boundaries"" because I texted so much and it never bothered him.  Didn't even talk about my angry texts where I explained that I thought ""systematically working through the feelings with a past patient didn't mean ""she missed sessions and got referred out"".  He never worked through my feelings,rather was REALLY eager to know what I REALLY EXACTLY feel towards him and then said ""if we weren't in the therapeutic relationship I would have wanted to get to know you better too"" (no idea if he said it to not hurt my feelings/lets me feel rejected)!  When I was seemingly devasted&amp;asked if it's possible to keep in sporadically contact he asked in what way and when I said ""like normal non therapeutic"" he replied ""anything else?"" guess he meant ""getting to know him"" but not too sure. But he said we could do that on weekends... Nevertheless now I'm sitting here heartbroken and feel completely abandoned"
emotional,How to confront my family,"Wasn__ sure where to post this. Recently realized (through therapy) that I__e been emotionally abused all my life (especially in childhood) by my family, mostly my folks (generational). I__ at a spot where I want to start addressing it with them. My bf has been the biggest help working through this, but to him it seems like returning to an abuser (__hey can change_). I love my family, and I don__ want this to be an ultimatum. I__ just wondering if anyone else has gone through anything similar? How did you handle the situation? What was the outcome? What would you have done different?"
physical,He bought me a present,"We have a child together. I have a custody. He has a visitation. Our little one is preschool age. Stbxh Bought a present wrapped it and put it in little ones bag. I didn__ know it was there. It scared the hell out of me. At first I thought it might be for a little one. Then stbx sent a message that it__ __rom_ little one to me_  I have a criminal protective order. I consulted with friends who are local PD and they don__ think it__ a violation because we__e allowed to have peaceful contact.   We are really close to settling the divorce. My lawyer is afraid that if I reject this gift or make it an issue it__l get spun that I__ somehow rejecting his attempts at coparenting_  I feel trapped. I__ doing everything I can to no longer be his victim ,  keep little one and me safe, and to be stronger.  I hate that he can buy me gifts under the guise that it__ from little one. I haven__ opened it. I don__ think it__ anything dangerous or harmful (stbx is not that dumb). I think it is likely to be something very nice that stbx knows would have meaning for me_ The psychological warfare will not end.."
emotional,How do I leave? Living abroad with an emotional abuser,"We live in Vietnam. I am British, he is Vietnamese. We are married and have two children. One 4.5 years and the youngest 6 weeks. How do I leave?   I thought on too many occasions to pack my bags and take the kids on the next flight to England. I really wish I could but he would never agree to let me have the kids and he would report me for abduction (which is correct if I didn't get his consent and left the country). How do I find or even afford a lawyer for my defense. His family are incredibly rich and have government connections (it's highly corrupt here) so he will have a high chance of winning custody (to my understanding, we need to go through the courts here as this is where we reside). But I cannot stay here. I have no friends, no family (except my children of course). But I cannot leave them behind.  He generally believes he's the victim and I'm the abusive one. He even has me in doubts sometimes because he does literally make me feel like I've gone crazy and will tell me that too. But I know deep down that the things he says and does to me, I would never be so calculated to do.   I have also noticed recently that my oldest son is being affected by his behaviour. He constantly says to him ""you need to go to school"", ""why don't you know anything"", asks him why he can't read and calls him stupid and an idiot. My son is definitely behind for his age although I am trying to teach him from home (Vietnam's schools have been closed for almost the whole of this year due to the pandemic and don't look like they will open any time soon) obviously it is not my son's fault. But here in Vietnam emotional and physical abuse is just the norm for children and partners so I can't even turn the police, there's a few foundations but nothing for English speakers.  I've also tried leaving before. I packed enough things for my son and I and asked my friend (who no longer lives in the country) if I could stay with him whilst I find an apartment. We live with my husband's mum and he went upstairs to get her to stop me from leaving. In fact she is also a huge problem and further leads him to believe he does no wrong. The other week she came to break up our argument because i was just so warn out having to look after our new baby, all the nightfeeds and day feeds due to breastfeeding, teach our son, do cleaning, washing (because he would tell me how messy everything is) all while working (I work remotely as a freelancer so i got back to work after 2 weeks. No such thing as maternity leave). He owns a business and works from home too yet he sits up in the office and doesn't see the kids at all. Anyway my mother in law said that my husband is tired because he works a lot so he can go out and buy food for me. I could not believe it. My feelings were invalidated.  We have broken up before when my first was just a few months old. I lived with my parents in England still and he had to finish his degree in America. I had postnatal depression I had to deal with also and got therapy for this. But this depression also spiralled into an awful relationship with my own mum. She told me that I'd lost the perfect life I had because I'm overly sensitive and pushed him away. So I don't even have the support of my own mother which makes me even ashamed to go back home leaving my ""perfect life"" behind again  (The abuse she's given me and my brother is a whole other story).   It's an awful cycle that just goes round and round. There are good days. There are days he puts me down so much I just think my only way out is suicide. I feel I can't talk to anyone and if I do open up, I'm terrified to even go back to a good day as it reels me back in and makes me forget until the abuse starts again. How do I break the cycle?"

emotional,My ex left me emotionally and mentally exhausted to the point where I can__ control myself anymore. Now she is starting to date other people and I__ hurting still,We__e been broken up longer than we were together but something about how intense our relationship was in both positive in negative ways make me feel like I am unable to love another person besides her.   I was a very good boyfriend to her and made one mistake that made her uncomfortable with me after we broke up but she constantly uses it against me. Lately I__e been reaching out to her when I__ not feeling good like when my friend passed away. Or last night when I was having a lot of intrusive thoughts and I was scared.   These conversations always turn in to a conversations about our relationship. I__ never the one who brings it up but somehow she makes me feel like the reason we__e fighting about it is because of me. She will say stuff like the fact that I__ reaching out is dragging her back into her past. Even while we were together it was constantly a fight and she always made me feel less than her or that everything was my fault even though she was insecure because of her ex boyfriend and not being able to get over him.   She deleted our picture off Facebook yesterday and it crushed me for some reason. I don__ know why though. I don__ know what to do because right now I__ so angry with her but I__e felt this way before and I always go back to wanting to reach out again I don__ know how to stop myself
physical,I just don__ care anymore and am so tired,"We__e been no contact for almost three months and he__ been sentenced for almost two. Even without him in my life I__ still suffering. I__ just tired and don__ care about anything anymore. I miss him, I love him and I don__ want to fight anything anymore. What makes me mad is I know he doesn__ care. According to his PO he hasn__ done shit. No treatment, no therapy, nothing on his plea deal. It__ only been a month and I don__ know if he knows what resources are out there and if he can even afford to get into those things but...I don__ know.  If he did everything he was supposed to he would have been able to have contact with me but apparently I wasn__ enough incentive. Which of course makes me feel like shit because I__ never worth it in the end. I tried to leave so many times and he fought it so many times and now that I__ legally gone...I__ nothing. So much for ____l always pursue you and I__e never loved anyone like you._ Just another liar.  I__ so defeated and tired. I__ so done with the anxiety over his PO phone calls, the court dates, the interrogations, the fights and the defense. I__ so burnt out. The waves of being okay and then days like these are exhausting too. When does my life go back to normal? When does he stop having control? When can I finally let him go?  I just want to be who I was before I met him. I wasn__ as strong as I am now but I definitely was not as broken.  Next PO phone call in three days to tell me why he hasn__ done treatment is and what the new plan is; and I know these next three days are just going to be hell.   Why can__ I ever be worth it?"
physical,My(F24) fianc_©(M24) hit me for the first time but I never considered him an abuser. I feel lost and unsure what to do.,"We__e been together almost 8 years and engaged for almost 1. Yesturday he broke things off because an argument about an issue with us escalated out of control. It was out of know where and sudden. I don__ have marks or bruises and nothing hurts, it was just more scary and shocking than anything. He has had an incredibly hard up being that steamed from physical abuse from his dad and mental abuse from his mom. He has been going through a lot and was in the process of finding out if he has adhd. These issues have never come between us physically before and I was always willing to be by his side while he went through the trauma he was dealing with. He has never tried to control me or use anything against me, in fact he pushed me to be my own person. On my part, I did smother him and didn__ give him enough space a lot of the time so I wasn__ perfect in the relationship either and take full responsibility for my part. For him to loose control all of a sudden has thrown me for a loop and I feel stuck. I still love him and want to get back together because I never saw him as some sort of abuser but he decided to leave because of what he did and because of some issues we had that just were never properly communicated. He has always wanted to become the best version of himself but he wants to do it alone and on his own terms. Which I need to respect but he convinced himself he has to completely leave in order to accomplish that when we never had an issue with it before this physical incident. He said he wants to best for and I deserve better but all I ever wanted was him. And now that this has happened, is leaving an 8 year relationship and future marriage really the only answer? We had our future planned together and now it all feels like it__ in the trash because of this one incident. I__ not scared of him even with what happened. I__ scared of loosing him because of it.   TL;DR! My fianc_© hit me for the first time because of an argument about a repeated issue we had and completely escalated out of control. This has never happened before, even with some past trauma he is going through. He broke it off due to his actions and the separate issues we had that just was never properly communicated. I want to try and work things out but am confused on what to do because of this sudden physical act. I still love him and feel like I shouldn__ just throw away the future we had planned together"
physical,I just learned that restraining / blocking exits is classified as physical violence and I__ spiraling,"We__e both in our late 20__, been together since I was 20. It__ happened for so long I thought it was normal. Is it not?? The most recent instance resulted in a physical altercation which has led me to more research on emotional abuse_  I didn__ expect this to be classified as __iolence_. Idk. Sorry for ranting. It was the only time I__e been hurt and it was just a few bruises from falling, he didn__ hit me. I__ just so confused. Ever since it happened he__ promised to go to therapy, never drink again (he doesn__ usually but in that instance, he was drunk), etc. He__ been so loving and kind. I__ just scared it__ gonna come back around and we__e gonna be right back to where we started.  Tldr; is my husband physically violent??"
physical,"What are the signs for DV? Does it slowly creep up on you and suddenly one day you think to yourself, how did you end up here?","We__e married for 6 together for 7.5 years. Obviously during dating times or even early marriage, things were hard financially but sweet. Then came the frequent job hoppings, he couldn__ secure a stable career for our family and didn__ allow me to work. But I had to cos well, we have to eat.   I__ a freelancer, my jobs come in short 3-4 months contracts and require me to stay out for at least 12 hr shifts each time. He was never happy for me or my career and didn__ want me to go out to work or even go out without him.   Fast forward 2 years, I just finished a major project and got pregnant with our second. This time he had established himself a career and with 2 kids, it__ almost impossible to go back to my old job. So I didn__ work for awhile. Again same, whenever I try to bring the kids to the park or museum, and I would inform him of our plans but it feels like I__ threading on eggshells cos he is unhappy that we are going out, not in a way where he feels left out but rather he says he will __iss us_. So I said ok fine, we will head out less, and when we__e home, he ignores us and just does his work.   And when the kids are playing at home he throws a fit saying they are noisy and he can__ think (for his work). So obviously this has a very bad effect on our kids especially my elder child. Now she feels like she is threading on eggshells every time she plays with her sister cos daddy is working. And I see how this whole thing is affecting her negatively. She shouldn__ have to feel like that while playing at home.   So fast forward again to now, where I__ starting my own business to try and be independent and accrue some savings, cos even though he pays for bills and food and everything, he doesn__ give me money. Again, with my business when I tell him I need to go out to meet a client or do some supplier sourcing he isn__ happy with me stepping out of the house.   For 6 years now, every time I have activities outside the house, be it my own drs appointment, visiting my mum, work meetings alr play dates I get scared informing him of my plans. I have tried not informing him and of cos that makes it worse.    I__ hiding in the bathroom typing this after putting the kids for bedtime and even so, he texted me to ask me what am I doing and where I am.   Is he overly possessive and is this an early sign to Dv? Sometimes I feel so trapped."

emotional,TW: Why do people look down on others who __ad it easier_ because they weren__ beaten or __truggling_ through their childhood or life?,Went through a lot of emotional abuse as a kid. Apparently I__ bad at finding good people because I got engaged to someone whose dad is the same if not worse.   His dad says I had an easy childhood and I__ sensitive and ungrateful because I didn__ get beaten or have to sell drugs etc.   I waited almost every day to get __eaten_ so I would have a legal excuse to leave. I__ not afraid of being hit. I__ afraid of being trapped. And I__ tired of being told I have everything easy.   This is not to mean any disrespect towards those who have gone through physical abuse and such. This is also not to say it__ __asier_ to leave a physically abusive situation. Those were just real feelings I had when people would tell me I__ crazy/ungrateful or making my feelings up. Or maybe I was. Idk.
physical,I won my court case against my abuser!,"Went to court this week to face my abusive ex who contested the restraining order I was granted _ and he was denied! I get to keep my restraining order as is, including full custody of our 2 y.o. and zero contact/parenting time for right now.   Even though technically I won, it really doesn__ feel like a __in._ Restraining orders are just a tool. He could still hurt me. Plus, it obviously doesn__ take away the horrible things he did that have scarred me forever. I will never be the same. I struggle daily, and I honestly feel like my life is ruined from the impacts of his abuse.   I was shocked at how brazenly he lied to the judge during the hearing. There was video and photo evidence of his abuse, my resulting injuries, and damaged property. He just flat-out said it never happened and showed zero remorse or responsibility for his behavior. I don__ know what I was expecting, but this felt like another layer of betrayal and such an insult. He also did not even mention wanting to adjust parenting time/contact with our son. That was surprising and disappointing, in a way.    The whole experience was a total mind-fuck _ like a parade of continued gaslighting that really didn__ scratch the surface or accurately portray the extensive years of abuse I endured.   The day after the hearing, my adrenaline __ome down_ felt like I had been hit by a bus. The sides of my neck were so sore, tense, and swollen with muscle knots during the days before and after the hearing, which is interesting because my case involved strangulation.   I__e been cycling through another round of confusing grief and mourning of the relationship and all the lies he promised me, the love-bombing, the vows to protect me, the __oul mate and best friend_ claims he tried to manipulate me with into coming back after I left. It hurts and I hope this trauma bond dies soon. I__ grateful to have some peace from him. I hope he finds some sort of deep healing to stop hurting women and deserve a relationship with our child."
physical,"Is it abuse? Tw: physical, verbal, eating disorders","We've been married 13 years and for the vast majority of that time he wasn't like this. He could be kind of an asshole but the last three years have gotten progressively worse. Is it abuse to tug on my wrists or grab me to keep me from walking away during an argument?  He's only done it a couple times but this morning I had to get up early for a medical procedure and he wanted to argue. I didn't have time and it turned into him grabbing my wrist as I was going down the front steps and making me fall. Our son saw it and was scared, none of the kids have seen him act like that before. By the time I got home my husband was crying and apologetic.   We separated for a while because of his temper, he agreed to get treatment and moved back in and it isn't working out. I'm anorexic (in therapy) I'm at a low weight from stress and he's going between acting concerned for my health and using it against me. At the same time he tells me he prefers me small and my weight has been a thing he focused on our entire relationship.   I don't understand why he's being so mean. I don't know why he's antagonizing me after begging me to let him move back in.   The kids love him and they'd be devastated if he moved out again. I try to keep our problems away from the kids, idk how I would explain to them. I know it's weird but i don't want them to think that of him. I'm also afraid to leave because he's threatened to use my ed to take them.   Is it always destined to get worse, should I just deal with it? Part of me thinks I've put up with everything this long, I should wait for our oldest to turn 18."
physical,My family falsely accused my brother of rape to isolate him away from everyone and groom him into becoming a rapist. My family is full of rapist/ sexual predators/ sexual deviants. 6 years later I__ realizing this. And my brother Is codependent to my mother and he is now also narcissistic.,"What to dooo? I__ 23 now and my brother__ 20  OK so I understand that this is what happened because my mother did the same thing to me. She literally isolated me away from everyone at the same time as doing this to my brother by smear campaigning me with her own projections to my entire community. She told people that everything that I said out of my mouth was a lie, I am a bad influence on my brother, she feared for her life, she has to sleep with one eye open, I was inviting strange men to the home, I am a closeted bisexual person if not lesbian, I__ sexually deviant, I am out of control, she doesn__ know what or how to deal with me, she needs help, this matter is out of her hands, etc. I had people looking at me like they feared me and trying to avoid me, other people smirked and laughed because they were the same type of person my mother was...they knew I was innocent, they knew I was traumatized, they knew I was being preyed on.    I was 17 my brother was 14 my mother claimed our Younger cousin accused my brother of rape. I believe this was a part of the divide and conquer tactic. At the time my mother kept moving us from one traumatic home to another in order to break us down so that we can become just like her narcissistic and psychotic. My mother put us in therapy at a sexual abuse institute mainly for children who were sexual abuse or__. She wanted a paper trail to correlate with her accusations of us before she started accusing us of these things. She was the one sexually abusing us.   I always had my brothers back until this instance. I felt devastated because I had gone through similar things that my mother described my brother asked to doing to my cousin. I specifically think she said those things because she knew that I went through them and that would__e traumatized me and triggered me into not having my brothers back anymore.   He was moved out of the home and had to move in with my equally as insane sister who took after my mother. We were isolated from one another both good-natured children. The goal was to brainwash us to traumatize us to break us and we don__ have one another to rely on. I also think this rumor was just a classic narcissistic behavior to try to isolate someone to accuse him of rape and then have people hating this person who__ accused of rape and this person is only isolated with the people who supposedly have his back which is the same people who created these rumors_ my mother and my family. That was the goal to isolate this person and groom them into becoming everything they accused him of already being guilty of. And then say see he__ always been thus way. Self fulfilling prophecy. They wanted to mold him into becoming a rapist_ a child sexual predator. My family is filled with child sexual predators. They were projecting their own perversions onto him and my mother was sexually abusing him at the time. They were hoping he__ turn into one of them.   Around this time they had tried to pervert my brother and I relationship. And the year before my cousin tried to pervert my relationship with her brother... she tried molding me into his sexdoll and I said no.   I never talked to my brother about the accusations. It was too hard on me to even confront because I hadn__ dealt with my own sexual abuse trauma and I kind of believed the rumors because it was a younger female cousin. However, what__ eerie is that I only heard my mother and other family members who are just as narcissistic and psychotic accuse my brother of the stuff.  I never heard the young cousin say this. Either she never said it or she was trying to say it. They sad my younger cousin went to the police with her mom to give a statement but they didn__ press charges because I didn__ want to ruin my brothers life to be on the sex offender__ list Because he was 14. I do not believe that they actually went anywhere to give any statement. I believe that this was a scare tactic. I believe they were trying to literally brainwashed us into believing all this shit was true and for my brother to become a sexual deviant like my family.  My mother admitted to being a sexual deviant through projecting such things on to me. I believe she got sexual gratification through corrupting our family in such ways. She was the one to start molesting my brother at the age of 12 and then later on when he was 14 told me that my younger cousin accused him of molesting her . My aunt tried insinuating that my brother and I relationship was perverted when in actuality she knows my mother, her sister, was the one to pervert her relationship with her own son, my brother_ it was a projection. They were corrupt and hoping to corrupt us three different tactics projection brainwashing blame shifting stonewalling fear tactics."
emotional,Is this wrong?,When I was 13 I was having a panic attack and my father pinned me down and had his knee on my chest. He weighed 200lbs and at the time I weighed 70lbs. I couldn__ breathe and eventually he just sat on me and held my wrists against the ground even though I was only crying and not being violent or anything. Is this abuse?
physical,I__ a domestic abuse survivor and I have never reported it,"When I was 19-21 I was in a relationship with someone who abused me. I__ in the U.K. there was  1 count of rape  He physically assaulted me poking me in my eye Verbal abuse,  Threats to kill me/set my house on fire if I didn__ terminate pregnancy  1 attack in public which bouncers at a nightclub luckily managed to intertwine 1 restrainment where he wouldn__ let me leave his house  Physical abuse. Unfortunately blacked this out but I remember having bruises on my leg   This was 7 years ago. I don__ have same phone or texts or proof or even dates anymore  I was young and felt it was my fault. I don__ feel I have justice. Is there anything I can do or am I too late"
emotional,Abuse worse after Breakup - His Last Grasping,"Who else has experienced even more intense abuse post breakup? I will be able to go NC after this coming week, but these last few days have been hell. We are figuring out financial aspects. His parents are helping him buy me out on our house and he is treating me like shit for trying to maintain boundaries and protect myself legally. Essentially I suggested he may need to wait a few days for his closing on refinancing in order for me to get a signed notarized promissory note from him and his dad (who has been out of the country). I was requesting that promise of payment prior to signing a quit claim deed to give up all my rights to the house we have shared. He started harassing me by text and then phone call. He started using his ""look at me I'm being calmer than you"" tone, but really I could feel him seething inside and jabbing me with his toxicity. He started laying into me the phone call, and among other things:  1. Asked if we could be adults about this - why do we need all this legal stuff? 2. Tried to make me feel guilty for the amount of money I'm getting (which is not even half of the value of everything I'm leaving behind, and does not even take into account considerable appreciation). ""You're taking a huge chunk of money from my parents."" WELL YEAH, because you don't know how to save and manage your finances so you have nothing saved to give me, and I contributed equally for a year and a half on top of much physical labor updating the house. 3. Tried to make me feel guilty for him *""allowing""* me to stay on his insurance for a month in order to get a few appointments taken care of before I figure out getting my own insurance -- when I have already paid him the full amount of my portion of the insurance before the month is up. 4. Trying to make me feel guilty that he, god forbid, has to take his own girls grocery shopping in the midst of going through a stressful time. Never mind that everything that is ""difficult"" for him right now has to do with the fact that he no longer has me there to parent/babysit his girls, no longer has me there to do the laundry, dishes, takeout trash, take care of the animals, manage our budget, do the grocery shopping, cook, etc. 5. And the real kicker - told me ""you only ever think about yourself."" OH, well that's pretty rich coming from someone with pretty strong narcissistic tendencies for whom I pushed so many of my own boundaries, needs, and joys down in order to please him and serve his children.  Anyway, at that point after maintaining calm amidst these jabs for quite a while, I basically was pushed to my ""reactive abuse"" edge - I yelled and swore and he hung up. He then started texting excuses and basically a non-apology (the words ""sorry"" or ""I apologize"" were never used). My mom witnessed this phone call, and this was actually quite validating because she saw how shitty it was and made me feel not so crazy. Still, I was fuming and shaking and couldn't believe this person I was no longer in a relationship with could still make me feel this awful. There was more shitty-ness today (for lack of a better term) through texts, but I refuse to talk on the phone with him again.   Luckily my mom is helping me a lot with handling the last few logistical things in the next few days, and then I should never have to talk with him again. So, this was a vent, but also curious, **who else has had this sort of terrible last grasping of vitriol from their emotional abuser when disentangling at the end?** You'd think he'd want to show me what a good person I'm leaving, but this has only strongly confirmed that I made the right decision."

Theres trouble in my eyes  Your presence was once a gift  The beauty in you still shines  I look in my mind  I look for what I cant find  A diamond in a haystack  And a needle on my mind  I heear Angel's when you speak  The trumpets herald the hopeless  I come running for my chance to be free  Give my soul bliss  The dark cloud rolls over  It used to be so bright and blue   I cant see the difference in heaven and earth  Instead all I see is you  Glass on the ground crunches  Drops of blood in the sink I've failed once again   Tonight the Angel's wont sing  But I can still see their glow  In that expression you share  I shudder and tremble  At that glorious stare  The noises get louder  My thoughts start to drown  I shouldn't have wouldnt have and maybe didnt  Still I've let you down  I fall quite a bit  And I hope for a hand  One day I know it will be there  Helping me make a stand  Still from the floor I see you sparkle  Theres a flutter deep within  Breathing gets shallow  Which is perfect; I cant swim  Drowning in puddles  Die of thirst by the well  I know that I'm lucky  And I'm fucking grateful to melt  Why am I tired?

emotional,Sanity check: I left my husband on Thanksgiving weekend. Now I'm visiting for Christmas. Did I do the right thing?,"-----Why I left:  On Thanksgiving weekend I left my home to stay in a hotel. I then went to the military equivalent of a domestic abuse shelter and also reported him. He has these anger tantrums to where he destroys things sometimes. Food, doors, cabinets, plates, mugs, etc. When he does this he doesn't necessarily do this towards me. Sometimes he's mad about something at work and let's out his anger on something. It's been 4 years of this. We have no kids.  He sees it as a way to vent. But it freaks me out. I feel like if I'm not careful that anger can be directed at me. The situation is highly unpredictable. I used to be a physically abusive relationship and it scares me to see him lash out of objects even though he swears he would never hurt me.   I've tried walking away when he gets like that and retreating to a safer space but he follows me and gets angry that I left.  I asked him to stop and told him why but he only did it less often, didn't quit completely. I tried yelling back at him but that only made me more susceptible to him directing anger at me. Lastly, I tried playing it cool on the outside when really I was freaking out on the inside. I just put up with it and pretended like I didn't care.  I left during Thanksgiving because my tactic of ""playing it cool"" didn't work this time around. He said he didn't like how I wasn't responding/looking at him. I froze up. He tossed some items down the stairs out of anger and yelled at me to take out the trash if I planned to run away.       -----What's happening now:  I found a room mate and I'm living away from the home for a minimum of 3 months until I can figure out what I want to do about our marriage. It's been 1 month so far and I'm still no longer closer on figuring out what I want to do.   On one hand, I'm seeing that there's a lot of fear on the way I navigated my day around him when we were living together. I felt that most days I couldn't really start my day until he left the home for something. I realize that I didn't want to communicate my true feelings about simple things out of fear of his reaction. It got to the point where I would hide books I was reading so that he didn't have a chance to pick it apart or criticize what I was reading. I couldn't tell him what was going on with my therapist because he would somehow find a way to pick it apart and undo all the work I was doing on myself. On the other hand, he really comes through on big things. For example, he financially took the reigns when I decided to return to college. He took care of me when my autoimmune disease flared up.  And he's incredibly loyal.  He still think I over reacted and that what he did wasn't abusive at all. He's open to getting help, but he has never responded well to therapy in the past.      -----Why I'm posting:   I know that I need the time to myself to figure out what to do, I feel like I got that part right. However, this is a life altering decision that I could really use some advice on. If you have any experience or just straight up an answer in what you would do in this situation, please let me know. I'll answer your questions too.  I'm watching to see what he's doing during this time. The first couple of weeks he was very angry but now he is calm and accepting that what happened happened (he still thinks I over reacted though. Did I?) I love him still but I'm also still on the fence. I have moments of doubt and moments of confidence about leaving. I just don't know."
physical,Abuse education resource needed,"Would anyone have resources for an issue I__ having with a gradeschool? My ex is abusive and just received residential custody of our first grader by being shady. The school will only provide one parent folder and have tasked my ex with letting me know what I need to know by passing on the materials to me. He won__ do that. He has refused to communicate for years. Abuse is about power and control, right?  I have tried to explain to the school, I__e detailed his history of refusal to communicate, I__e given examples of papers I have not gotten. They flat out refuse to make me a separate parent folder. I__ furious and feel honestly  retraumatized. I want to educate them on why this is not ok.  The cherry on top was that they reached out to him without my knowledge or consent to schedule a group meeting about this topic. I feel like that was dangerous and could have gotten me beat, put my property and even my life in jeopardy. They__e refusing to hear this and will only say that we need to communicate, which I obviously cannot control. Is there any research, videos, trainings, anything at all, that can help the teachers and staff understand what they are facilitating (further post separation abuse and alienation)?   I__ so upset that this is happening that I could honestly just have a full on temper tantrum right now. Ive gone to the superintendent and only the assistant will speak to me. Apparently there is a string teacher__ union in place and I__ not likely to make headway but, goddamnit, this is not right, it isn__ safe, and it__ not really excusable. I__ like to do something about this."
emotional,Should I tell my friend that her mother is possibly toxic or should I keep that thought to myself? (We live in Australia and we__e both minors),"Would it be helpful to do that or harmful? Or I just should stay out of it? I__ 16, she__ 17. She talks to me about her mum ruining holidays, getting really mad and holding grudges over minuscule shit, giving people the silent treatment or holing up in her room when she gets upset, screaming at her family, name-calling, generally being selfish, scaring her family by making them think she__ going to kill herself. My friend always asks why her mother is like this and why she does this. Apparently her mother was not always like this and her family was not always like this but it became a different way about two years ago.   Should I say maybe her mother is the way she is because she__ become toxic? She is very defensive of her mother. But on the other hand she seems confused about the situation. Obviously idk a lot about this situation and could be wrong about my thinking though. We live in Australia."
physical,Need advice for family friend in LA,"Would love any and all advice for how best to help our friend.   *WARNING: POTENTIAL TRIGGERS*  Our family has employed a wonderful nanny/housekeeper for our 2 young girls for several years. She is fantastic and a wonderful helper. Early 30s.   In the past, she had an abusive boyfriend who she broke off the relationship with. He would physically strike her and call her stupid, blame everything on her, etc.   We just found out that she had decided to get back together with the abuser in July; she has her own apartment where she is the only one on the lease, and she invited the boyfriend back to live with her. The abuser said he had changed and was on medicine. We learned he was back to abusive habits including demeaning her and hitting her. The boyfriend has a nighttime job pretty far away and Friday, before he left, he held a knife to the throat of our nanny. He threatened to have his friends track her down and kill her if she broke up with him, and to kill her entire family in El Salvador if she went to the police. She left a note saying she is going back to El Salvador, and she left and is now staying with another friend in her apartment. She only grabbed a few clothes and personal items and left most of her belongings, including her pet birds and dog. She has provided us with the photos, ID, and SSN of the boyfriend. She also has recorded on her iPhone the audio of when he held the knife to her throat and threatened to kill her. We want to help her, but the boyfriend knows she works at our home. He has actually dropped her off for work several times. While we would house her here gladly, we are concerned that he will stop by and look for her and/or her car, putting her in danger. We are also obviously concerned ab having this person even come to our house, period. It__ near impossible to get into our house due to walls and security gates but he could totally just wait outside and see if she goes in or out.   What is the best course of action here? We want to help her as much as possible (inducing paying her to not work for at least a while) but we are concerned for her and our own safety if she comes to our house. We would call the police but we are unsure of whether they can or will do anything. And it looks like evicting someone is very hard in California (even if not in the lease), and she has to find another apartment anyways. Also, she is so traumatized right now that we fear she will not be proactive in seeking help on her own.   Any advice or resources would be super helpful and thank you. We love her and want to help. What are the steps she should take? We figure a lawyer is first steps?"
physical,The Red Cup,"Years ago, my husband gave me a set of Red Colored Wine Glasses. He calls them the __ed Cup_.   On occasion, I will have 1-2 glasses of wine but according to him, it__ an every night, drunk fight fest.   So, he is constantly saying_.Oh, your an alcoholic, you need alcohol, you get that Red Cup and then it__ a fight all night.   That__ not true, I have my glass of wine and just go to bed. No words spoken.   Well, tonight he said it to me again._Oh you alcoholic! There__ that Red Cup again!   So I waited for him to go upstairs.   I quietly put all the Red Colored Wine Glasses in the trash can.   He comes downstairs, makes coffee and finds them in the trash.   HE WENT CRAZY. I told him I was taking away his weapons.   He is furious.  Tell me_what__ going on? Is this anger because I__e taken one of his weapons???   Haha if that__ why he is mad."

emotional,is my mother emotinally abusive?,"Yesterday she was talking about sister saying her doctor gives stimulants I asked her so she is taking stimulants she had this smirk on her face like when a child does something they know they are not meant to.  Later on I said I am going to ask sister about it, she proceeds to tell me she never said that and then said she will never speak to me again and then gave me a lecture on how "" peoples medical details are private"" at that point I felt gaslit I felt something in my gut telling me she is trying to twist it. I said well then dont tell me I dont need a lecture she proceeded to say how im out of line. I left it it wasn't worth getting into the drama she was trying to stir.   Then today I went to study statistics. I am struggling with it cause I struggled with maths she never helped me only screamed at me when I was younger over not getting stuff, but she is good at maths. I take out the book and try after year's to see if she would be better at helping me ' big mistake ' my mother has a very abrupt way about her movements she's not a gentle affectionate woman and physically cold. She started off being nice enough and then 5 minutes says give me a piece of paper she grabs it off me and then scribbles the formula I am already feeling put off by her demeanor but try to ignore it and focus on the work. Got through one page, next page she turns abruptly anymore rough and the page would have ripped. I now remembered why I never asked for help when I was younger felt uneasy. She then goes "" Jesus this is pretty self explanatory"" I basically felt in that moment she called me ( your dumb as hell ) I felt degraded and humiliated. I said I'll do it myself thanks. She leaves, she then comes back in talking about maths problem and I said please dont talk to me unless you apologiseno until you apologise. God your a pain in the ass"" and slams the door. I am trying to study and not burst our crying and feeling extremely depressed at this point I can't focus at all and watch a study video. I feel this enormous tension like im walking on eggshells.  She avoids me all day and then at the end goes in this sweet butter couldn't melt voice "" are you still in a bad mood? Acting as if she actually cares about my feelings which she clearly doesn't. I feel it's hard to associate the person she was before with the one who wants to be ' friends ' again and I always used to fall for it until I was kicked down again. Now I leave the house. I am struggling right now. I had an illness for year's that she enabled and am trying to find my feet by studying a course, I've never being given tools to be independent and always relied on her to help me cause of my autism. I have  no financial support other than my mother who treats me like this. I am struggling to hold on to be honest. I've got through being this isolated depressed before so I know I can do it. Just looking for some reassurance or advice?"
physical,What Can I (F19) Do For My Dad (46M)?,"Yesterday was a huge mess, being Valentine's and all. My mom (38) is really abusive towards my dad.   I started noticing it as a young kid. My dad used to be kind of shitty, he was an alcoholic/financially a wreck/recklessly driving but the bills were paid. He just spent more time at bars than at home.  My dad got into a car accident when I was 9, he wasn't driving but walking. He got hit by a van, and his skull got fractured in 16 places I think. He should not have lived. After the accident he was different. He's a recovering alcoholic, he's been sober for a couple of years and won't even eat pizza if it has a lot of yeast. He told me that my mother hit him with our van, and didn't take him to the hospital immediately.  After that accident, my mother accused him of cheating on her. My dad claimed that he didn't, but he didn't remember much before his accident. He doesn't remember a lot from before, he remembers his childhood but he doesn't entirely remember my milestones or things my mom had done to me. After she accused him, he completely deleted facebook/whatever. That wasn't enough, because later on she made him get rid of his phone. And this year, she made him quit his job. She threatened to kick him out if he didn't quit, and he isn't allowed to have any private discussions with me.  Over the years, she's completely isolated him. My dad doesn't get to speak to friends, go into stores, isn't allowed to work, or He'll get called a cheater. My dad isn't allowed to even acknowledge my sister and I as girls.  My dad married her even though she acted like this maybe 6 years ago, and for awhile she was okay. Overnight, she went from the honeymoon period to acting even worse. She regularly punches my dad in the glasses trying to break them, and he's bent them back into place many times now. Several times a week I see new marks on my dad's face, and I can't take it. I've been trying to get a place, so that my sister and I can get away from that narcissist of a woman.  She slammed his hand in the door when he talked about getting a job, she punched him in the nose causing a lot of marks, cracked one of his teeth, etc.  Even worse? She said that if he does something she doesn't like, she'll go down to the police and report him for marital r*pe.  She's over in my kitchen talking about how she puts so much into this relationship, and she's mad my dad can't stay perfectly calm when SHES ON A DATING APP.  I've seen her on match.com when I was 13, and told my father.  Yesterday she tells my father ""I'm going to go out on a last minute date with a real man who will do something for me on Valentine's""  SHE WONT LET HIM WORK, HE DOESN'T GET ANY POCKET MONEY FROM HER EITHER.  Can I please get some resources for men who are experiencing physical violence/financial abuse? My dad doesn't want to go to the police because my mom will accuse him of anything even if he didn't actually do it.  I live in the US in NJ.  Thank you for reading all this and for any resources you can provide. I'm having trouble finding male specific resources."
emotional,Is there hope?,"Yesterday, I left and I don't know if it's over or not. It all hit me at once, that it's not going to get better if I stayed. I'm absolutely heartbroken and I don't want to break my family up, but also can't show our kids this is normal. The babies and I are at my parents for now.  Some background: there have been big blow-out fights in the past. Usually alcohol was involved, but it started happening sober too. Then it started happening in front of our kids.  It feels like if I say ""no"" in any way that is not completely neutral, even, and level headed, I get a barrage of anger. Actually, sometimes even any ""no"" is met with this. I understand that I have a part too--I have definitely gotten snappy, been too rigid and have difficulty expressing my emotions sometimes. However, I don't think it warrants being told that I'm defective, damaged, and broken. In anger, he has told me that my family is fucked up, I'm psychotic, I'm a slut, that I'm terrible at my profession. Nothing seems off limits.   When I told him I couldn't stay in the house any longer and had to go to my parents, he threatened that it was over. He threatened that my parents couldnt come to the wedding. He told me (again) that my family is fucked up.   I'm very close with my parents and love them immensely. They are supportive and lovely people. They want whatever is best for us.   I don't know if there's any hope. I wrote him a letter expressing that the hurtful things he says need to stop and that more than anything, I want our family to stay together. He said that was attacking him and that if I wasn't so rigid and just let him do x,y,z then he wouldn't say those things. It always comes back that I'm the root of the problem.   Idk what I'm looking for with this post. If I really am the problem, I'm open to changing things. But I'm so so sick of hiding this awful dynamic. I want it to get better, but Idk how to do that."
emotional,Is there hope?,"Yesterday, I left and I don't know if it's over or not. It all hit me at once, that it's not going to get better if I stayed.

emotional,You are not the exception to the rule.,"You were not abused because you brought out the worst in them. You were abused because they are an abuser.   You would likely agree that no matter how mad someone is, it is never okay to name-call, berate, dehumanize, ruthlessly discard, humiliate, disparage, scream at, or emotionally manipulate another human being. Right? Well, dearest human _ this includes you.   If you are like me, you have spent much of your precious time desperately trying to understand what happened: *WHY did this happen to you?* What might *you* have done to cause the yelling, the vitriol, the contempt? Are you really so bad that they had no ability to treat you lovingly? What did you do to deserve it? Might you have actually deserved it?  *NO.*  Let that be the clearest point in this post: **You. did. not. deserve. it. There is NOTHING you could do that could ever justify, explain, or make right the ways the they abused you.** This is an unequivocal and invariable truth. (That includes you.)   Ask yourself: is it *ever* okay for *me* to name-call, berate, dehumanize, ruthlessly discard, humiliate, disparage, scream at, or emotionally manipulate another human being? The answer is likely no. It is never okay to do that to someone. And sweet person _ that includes you, too.   You are not the exception to these fundamental truths of love and kindness. You deserve them as much as every one of us, and it is out there, waiting for you and your big, beautiful heart."
